<h4>THROWN ON THE WORLD</h4>

<p>"Miss Winnifred," said the Old
Lawyer, looking keenly over and
through his shaggy eyebrows at
the fair young creature seated
before him, "you are this morning twenty-one."</p>

<p>Winnifred Clair raised her deep mourning
veil, lowered her eyes and folded her hands.</p>

<p>"This morning," continued Mr. Bonehead,
"my guardianship is at an end."</p>

<p>There was a tone of something like emotion
in the voice of the stern old lawyer, while for
a moment his eye glistened with something
like a tear which he hastened to remove with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
something like a handkerchief. "I have therefore
sent for you," he went on, "to render you
an account of my trust."</p>

<p>He heaved a sigh at her, and then, reaching
out his hand, he pulled the woollen bell-rope
up and down several times.</p>

<p>An aged clerk appeared.</p>

<p>"Did the bell ring?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I think it did," said the Lawyer. "Be good
enough, Atkinson, to fetch me the papers of
the estate of the late Major Clair defunct."</p>

<p>"I have them here," said the clerk, and he
laid upon the table a bundle of faded blue
papers, and withdrew.</p>

<p>"Miss Winnifred," resumed the Old Lawyer,
"I will now proceed to give you an account of
the disposition that has been made of your
property. This first document refers to the
sum of two thousand pounds left to you by
your great uncle. It is lost."</p>

<p>Winnifred bowed.</p>

<p>"Pray give me your best attention and I will
endeavour to explain to you how I lost it."</p>

<p>"Oh, sir," cried Winnifred, "I am only a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
poor girl unskilled in the ways of the world,
and knowing nothing but music and French; I
fear that the details of business are beyond my
grasp. But if it is lost, I gather that it is
gone."</p>

<p>"It is," said Mr. Bonehead. "I lost it in a
marginal option in an undeveloped oil company.
I suppose that means nothing to you."</p>

<p>"Alas," sighed Winnifred, "nothing."</p>

<p>"Very good," resumed the Lawyer. "Here
next we have a statement in regard to the
thousand pounds left you under the will of
your maternal grandmother. I lost it at Monte
Carlo. But I need not fatigue you with the
details."</p>

<p>"Pray spare them," cried the girl.</p>

<p>"This final item relates to the sum of fifteen
hundred pounds placed in trust for you by your
uncle. I lost it on a horse race. That horse,"
added the Old Lawyer with rising excitement,
"ought to have won. He was coming down the
stretch like blue&mdash;but there, there, my dear,
you must forgive me if the recollection of it
still stirs me to anger. Suffice it to say the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
horse fell. I have kept for your inspection
the score card of the race, and the betting
tickets. You will find everything in order."</p>

<p>"Sir," said Winnifred, as Mr. Bonehead
proceeded to fold up his papers, "I am but a
poor inadequate girl, a mere child in business,
but tell me, I pray, what is left to me of the
money that you have managed?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," said the Lawyer. "Everything
is gone. And I regret to say, Miss Clair, that
it is my painful duty to convey to you a further
disclosure of a distressing nature. It concerns
your birth."</p>

<p>"Just Heaven!" cried Winnifred, with a
woman's quick intuition. "Does it concern
my father?"</p>

<p>"It does, Miss Clair. Your father was not
your father."</p>

<p>"Oh, sir," exclaimed Winnifred. "My poor
mother! How she must have suffered!"</p>

<p>"Your mother was not your mother," said
the Old Lawyer gravely. "Nay, nay, do not
question me. There is a dark secret about
your birth."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>"Alas," said Winnifred, wringing her hands,
"I am, then, alone in the world and penniless."</p>

<p>"You are," said Mr. Bonehead, deeply
moved. "You are, unfortunately, thrown upon
the world. But, if you ever find yourself in a
position where you need help and advice, do
not scruple to come to me. Especially," he
added, "for advice. And meantime let me ask
you in what way do you propose to earn your
livelihood?"</p>

<p>"I have my needle," said Winnifred.</p>

<p>"Let me see it," said the Lawyer.</p>

<p>Winnifred showed it to him.</p>

<p>"I fear," said Mr. Bonehead, shaking his
head, "you will not do much with that."</p>

<p>Then he rang the bell again.</p>

<p>"Atkinson," he said, "take Miss Clair out
and throw her on the world."<br /><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="I_II" id="I_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h3>

<h4>A RENCOUNTER</h4>


<p>As Winnifred Clair passed down the stairway
leading from the Lawyer's office, a figure
appeared before her in the corridor, blocking
the way. It was that of a tall, aristocratic-looking
man, whose features wore that peculiarly
saturnine appearance seen only in the English
nobility. The face, while entirely gentlemanly
in its general aspect, was stamped with all the
worst passions of mankind.</p>

<p>Had the innocent girl but known it, the face
was that of Lord Wynchgate, one of the most
contemptible of the greater nobility of Britain,
and the figure was his too.</p>

<p>"Ha!" exclaimed the dissolute Aristocrat,
"whom have we here? Stay, pretty one, and
let me see the fair countenance that I divine
behind your veil."</p>

<p>"Sir," said Winnifred, drawing herself up
proudly, "let me pass, I pray."</p>

<p>"Not so," cried Wynchgate, reaching out and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
seizing his intended victim by the wrist, "not
till I have at least seen the colour of those eyes
and imprinted a kiss upon those fair lips."</p>

<p>With a brutal laugh, he drew the struggling
girl towards him.</p>

<p>In another moment the aristocratic villain
would have succeeded in lifting the veil of the
unhappy girl, when suddenly a ringing voice
cried, "Hold! stop! desist! begone! lay to!
cut it out!"</p>

<p>With these words a tall, athletic young man,
attracted doubtless by the girl's cries, leapt
into the corridor from the street without. His
figure was that, more or less, of a Greek god,
while his face, although at the moment inflamed
with anger, was of an entirely moral
and permissible configuration.</p>

<p>"Save me! save me!" cried Winnifred.</p>

<p>"I will," cried the Stranger, rushing towards
Lord Wynchgate with uplifted cane.</p>

<p>But the cowardly Aristocrat did not await
the onslaught of the unknown.</p>

<p>"You shall yet be mine!" he hissed in
Winnifred's ear, and, releasing his grasp, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
rushed with a bound past the rescuer into
the street.</p>

<p>"Oh, sir," said Winnifred, clasping her
hands and falling on her knees in gratitude.
"I am only a poor inadequate girl, but if the
prayers of one who can offer naught but her
prayers to her benefactor can avail to the
advantage of one who appears to have every
conceivable advantage already, let him know
that they are his."</p>

<p>"Nay," said the stranger, as he aided the
blushing girl to rise, "kneel not to me, I beseech.
If I have done aught to deserve the
gratitude of one who, whoever she is, will remain
for ever present as a bright memory in the
breast of one in whose breast such memories are
all too few, he is all too richly repaid. If she
does that, he is blessed indeed."</p>

<p>"She does. He is!" cried Winnifred, deeply
moved. "Here on her knees she blesses him.
And now," she added, "we must part. Seek
not to follow me. One who has aided a poor
girl in the hour of need will respect her wish
when she tells him that, alone and buffeted by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
the world, her one prayer is that he will leave
her."</p>

<p>"He will!" cried the Unknown. "He
will. He does."</p>

<p>"Leave me, yes, leave me," exclaimed
Winnifred.</p>

<p>"I will," said the Unknown.</p>

<p>"Do, do," sobbed the distraught girl. "Yet
stay, one moment more. Let she, who has
received so much from her benefactor, at least
know his name."</p>

<p>"He cannot! He must not!" exclaimed
the Indistinguishable. "His birth is such&mdash;but
enough!"</p>

<p>He tore his hand from the girl's detaining
clasp and rushed forth from the place.</p>

<p>Winnifred Clair was alone.

<h3><a name="I_III" id="I_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h3>

<h4>FRIENDS IN DISTRESS</h4>


<p>Winnifred was now in the humblest lodgings
in the humblest part of London. A
simple bedroom and sitting-room sufficed for
her wants. Here she sat on her trunk, bravely
planning for the future.</p>

<p>"Miss Clair," said the Landlady, knocking
at the door, "do try to eat something. You
must keep up your health. See, I've brought
you a kippered herring."</p>

<p>Winnifred ate the herring, her heart filled
with gratitude. With renewed strength she
sallied forth on the street to resume her vain
search for employment. For two weeks now
Winnifred Clair had sought employment even
of the humblest character. At various dress-making
establishments she had offered, to no
purpose, the services of her needle. They had
looked at it and refused it.</p>

<p>In vain she had offered to various editors
and publishers the use of her pen. They had
examined it coldly and refused it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>She had tried fruitlessly to obtain a position
of trust. The various banks and trust companies
to which she had applied declined her
services. In vain she had advertised in the
newspapers offering to take sole charge of a
little girl. No one would give her one.</p>

<p>Her slender stock of money which she had
in her purse on leaving Mr. Bonehead's office
was almost consumed.</p>

<p>Each night the unhappy girl returned to her
lodging exhausted with disappointment and
fatigue.</p>

<p>Yet even in her adversity she was not
altogether friendless.</p>

<p>Each evening, on her return home, a soft
tap was heard at the door.</p>

<p>"Miss Clair," said the voice of the Landlady,
"I have brought you a fried egg. Eat it.
You must keep up your strength."</p>

<p>Then one morning a terrible temptation had
risen before her.</p>

<p>"Miss Clair," said the manager of an agency
to which she had applied, "I am glad to be able
at last to make you a definite offer of employ<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>ment.
Are you prepared to go upon the
stage?"</p>

<p>The stage!</p>

<p>A flush of shame and indignation swept over
the girl. Had it come to this? Little versed
in the world as Winnifred was, she knew but
too well the horror, the iniquity, the depth of
degradation implied in the word.</p>

<p>"Yes," continued the agent, "I have a letter
here asking me to recommend a young lady of
suitable refinement to play the part of Eliza in
<i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i>. Will you accept?"</p>

<p>"Sir," said Winnifred proudly, "answer me
first this question fairly. If I go upon the
stage, can I, as Eliza, remain as innocent, as
simple as I am now?"</p>

<p>"You can not," said the manager.</p>

<p>"Then, sir," said Winnifred, rising from her
chair, "let me say this. Your offer is doubtless
intended to be kind. Coming from the
class you do, and inspired by the ideas you are,
you no doubt mean well. But let a poor girl,
friendless and alone, tell you that rather than
accept such a degradation she will die."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very good," said the manager.</p>

<p>"I go forth," cried Winnifred, "to perish."</p>

<p>"All right," said the manager.</p>

<p>The door closed behind her. Winnifred
Clair, once more upon the street, sank down
upon the steps of the building in a swoon.</p>

<p>But at this very juncture Providence, which
always watches over the innocent and defenceless,
was keeping its eye direct upon Winnifred.</p>

<p>At that very moment when our heroine
sank fainting upon the doorstep, a handsome
equipage, drawn by two superb black steeds,
happened to pass along the street.</p>

<p>Its appearance and character proclaimed it
at once to be one of those vehicles in which
only the superior classes of the exclusive
aristocracy are privileged to ride. Its sides
were emblazoned with escutcheons, insignia
and other paraphernalia. The large gilt
coronet that appeared up its panelling, surmounted
by a bunch of huckleberries, quartered
in a field of potatoes, indicated that its possessor
was, at least, of the rank of marquis.
A coachman and two grooms rode in front,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
while two footmen, seated in the boot, or box
at the rear, contrived, by the immobility of
their attitude and the melancholy of their faces,
to inspire the scene with an exclusive and
aristocratic grandeur.</p>

<p>The occupants of the equipage&mdash;for we refuse
to count the menials as being such&mdash;were
two in number, a lady and gentleman, both
of advanced years. Their snow-white hair
and benign countenances indicated that they
belonged to that rare class of beings to whom
rank and wealth are but an incentive to nobler
things. A gentle philanthropy played all over
their faces, and their eyes sought eagerly in
the passing scene of the humble street for
new objects of benefaction.</p>

<p>Those acquainted with the countenances of
the aristocracy would have recognized at
once in the occupants of the equipage the
Marquis of Muddlenut and his spouse, the
Marchioness.</p>

<p>It was the eye of the Marchioness which
first detected the form of Winnifred Clair upon
the doorstep.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hold! pause! stop!" she cried, in lively
agitation.</p>

<p>The horses were at once pulled in, the brakes
applied to the wheels, and with the aid of
a powerful lever, operated by three of the
menials, the carriage was brought to a standstill.</p>

<p>"See! Look!" cried the Marchioness.
"She has fainted. Quick, William, your flask.
Let us hasten to her aid."</p>

<p>In another moment the noble lady was
bending over the prostrate form of Winnifred
Clair, and pouring brandy between her lips.</p>

<p>Winnifred opened her eyes. "Where am
I?" she asked feebly.</p>

<p>"She speaks!" cried the Marchioness.
"Give her another flaskful."</p>

<p>After the second flask the girl sat up.</p>

<p>"Tell me," she cried, clasping her hands,
"what has happened? Where am I?"</p>

<p>"With friends!" answered the Marchioness.
"But do not essay to speak. Drink this. You
must husband your strength. Meantime, let
us drive you to your home."</p>

<p>Winnifred was lifted tenderly by the men-servants
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
into the aristocratic equipage. The
brake was unset, the lever reversed, and the
carriage thrown again into motion.</p>

<p>On the way Winnifred, at the solicitation of
the Marchioness, related her story.</p>

<p>"My poor child!" exclaimed the lady, "how
you must have suffered. Thank Heaven it is
over now. To-morrow we shall call for you
and bring you away with us to Muddlenut
Chase."</p>

<p>Alas, could she but have known it, before
the morrow should dawn, worse dangers still
were in store for our heroine. But what these
dangers were, we must reserve for another
chapter.<br />

<h4>A GAMBLING PARTY IN ST. JAMES'S CLOSE</h4>


<p>We must now ask our readers to shift the
scene&mdash;if they don't mind doing this for us&mdash;to
the apartments of the Earl of Wynchgate in
St. James's Close. The hour is nine o'clock
in the evening, and the picture before us is one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
of revelry and dissipation so characteristic of
the nobility of England. The atmosphere of
the room is thick with blue Havana smoke such
as is used by the nobility, while on the green
baize table a litter of counters and cards, in
which aces, kings, and even two spots are
heaped in confusion, proclaim the reckless
nature of the play.</p>

<p>Seated about the table are six men, dressed
in the height of fashion, each with collar and
white necktie and broad white shirt, their faces
stamped with all, or nearly all, of the baser
passions of mankind.</p>

<p>Lord Wynchgate&mdash;for he it was who sat at
the head of the table&mdash;rose with an oath, and
flung his cards upon the table.</p>

<p>All turned and looked at him, with an oath.
"Curse it, Dogwood," he exclaimed, with
another oath, to the man who sat beside him.
"Take the money. I play no more to-night.
My luck is out."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" laughed Lord Dogwood, with
a third oath, "your mind is not on the cards.
Who is the latest young beauty, pray, who so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
absorbs you? I hear a whisper in town of a
certain misadventure of yours&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dogwood," said Wynchgate, clenching his
fist, "have a care, man, or you shall measure
the length of my sword."</p>

<p>Both noblemen faced each other, their hands
upon their swords.</p>

<p>"My lords, my lords!" pleaded a distinguished-looking
man of more advanced years,
who sat at one side of the table, and in whose
features the habitu&eacute;s of diplomatic circles
would have recognized the handsome lineaments
of the Marquis of Frogwater, British
Ambassador to Siam, "let us have no quarrelling.
Come, Wynchgate, come, Dogwood,"
he continued, with a mild oath, "put up your
swords. It were a shame to waste time in
private quarrelling. They may be needed all
too soon in Cochin China, or, for the matter of
that," he added sadly, "in Cambodia or in
Dutch Guinea."</p>

<p>"Frogwater," said young Lord Dogwood,
with a generous flush, "I was wrong. Wynchgate,
your hand."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>The two noblemen shook hands.</p>

<p>"My friends," said Lord Wynchgate, "in
asking you to abandon our game, I had an end
in view. I ask your help in an affair of the
heart."</p>

<p>"Ha! excellent!" exclaimed the five noblemen.
"We are with you heart and soul."</p>

<p>"I propose this night," continued Wynchgate,
"with your help, to carry off a young girl, a
female!"</p>

<p>"An abduction!" exclaimed the Ambassador
somewhat sternly. "Wynchgate, I cannot
countenance this."</p>

<p>"Mistake me not," said the Earl, "I intend
to abduct her. But I propose nothing dishonourable.
It is my firm resolve to offer her
marriage."</p>

<p>"Then," said Lord Frogwater, "I am with
you."</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," concluded Wynchgate, "all is
ready. The coach is below. I have provided
masks, pistols, and black cloaks. Follow me."</p>

<p>A few moments later, a coach, with the
blinds drawn, in which were six noblemen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
armed to the teeth, might have been seen, were
it not for the darkness, approaching the humble
lodging in which Winnifred Clair was sheltered.</p>

<p>But what it did when it got there, we must
leave to another chapter.
<br />
<br />
</p>


<h3><a name="I_V" id="I_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h3>

<h4>THE ABDUCTION</h4>


<p>The hour was twenty minutes to ten on the
evening described in our last chapter.</p>

<p>Winnifred Clair was seated, still fully
dressed, at the window of the bedroom, looking
out over the great city.</p>

<p>A light tap came at the door.</p>

<p>"If it's a fried egg," called Winnifred softly,
"I do not need it. I ate yesterday."</p>

<p>"No," said the voice of the Landlady. "You
are wanted below."</p>

<p>"I!" exclaimed Winnifred, "below!"</p>

<p>"You," said the Landlady, "below. A party
of gentlemen have called for you."</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," exclaimed Winnifred, putting her hand to her brow in
perplexity, "for me! at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> this late hour! Here! This evening! In this
house?"</p>

<p>"Yes," repeated the Landlady, "six gentlemen. They arrived in a closed
coach. They are all closely masked and heavily armed. They beg you will
descend at once."</p>

<p>"Just Heaven!" cried the Unhappy Girl. "Is it possible that they mean to
abduct me?"</p>

<p>"They do," said the Landlady. "They said so!"</p>

<p>"Alas!" cried Winnifred, "I am powerless. Tell them"&mdash;she
hesitated&mdash;"tell them I will be down immediately. Let them not come up.
Keep them below on any pretext. Show them an album. Let them look at the
goldfish. Anything, but not here! I shall be ready in a moment."</p>

<p>Feverishly she made herself ready. As
hastily as possible she removed all traces of
tears from her face. She threw about her
shoulders an opera cloak, and with a light
Venetian scarf half concealed the beauty of her
hair and features. "Abducted!" she murmured,
"and by six of them! I think she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
said six. Oh, the horror of it!" A touch of
powder to her cheeks and a slight blackening of
her eyebrows, and the courageous girl was ready.</p>

<p>Lord Wynchgate and his companions&mdash;for
they it was, that is to say, they were it&mdash;sat
below in the sitting-room looking at the albums.
"Woman," said Lord Wynchgate to the Landlady,
with an oath, "let her hurry up. We have
seen enough of these. We can wait no longer."</p>

<p>"I am here," cried a clear voice upon the
threshold, and Winnifred stood before them.
"My lords, for I divine who you are and wherefore
you have come, take me, do your worst
with me, but spare, oh, spare this humble
companion of my sorrow."</p>

<p>"Right-oh!" said Lord Dogwood, with a
brutal laugh.</p>

<p>"Enough," exclaimed Wynchgate, and seizing
Winnifred by the waist, he dragged her
forth out of the house and out upon the street.</p>

<p>But something in the brutal violence of his
behaviour seemed to kindle for the moment a
spark of manly feeling, if such there were, in
the breasts of his companions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wynchgate," cried young Lord Dogwood,
"my mind misgives me. I doubt if this is a
gentlemanly thing to do. I'll have no further
hand in it."</p>

<p>A chorus of approval from his companions
endorsed his utterance. For a moment they
hesitated.</p>

<p>"Nay," cried Winnifred, turning to confront
the masked faces that stood about her, "go
forward with your fell design. I am here. I
am helpless. Let no prayers stay your hand.
Go to it."</p>

<p>"Have done with this!" cried Wynchgate,
with a brutal oath. "Shove her in the coach."</p>

<p>But at the very moment the sound of hurrying
footsteps was heard, and a clear, ringing,
manly, well-toned, vibrating voice cried, "Hold!
Stop! Desist! Have a care, titled villain, or
I will strike you to the earth."</p>

<p>A tall aristocratic form bounded out of the
darkness.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," cried Wynchgate, releasing
his hold upon the frightened girl, "we are
betrayed. Save yourselves. To the coach."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>In another instant the six noblemen had
leaped into the coach and disappeared down
the street.</p>

<p>Winnifred, still half inanimate with fright,
turned to her rescuer, and saw before her the
form and lineaments of the Unknown Stranger,
who had thus twice stood between her and
disaster. Half fainting, she fell swooning into
his arms.</p>

<p>"Dear lady," he exclaimed, "rouse yourself.
You are safe. Let me restore you to your
home!"</p>

<p>"That voice!" cried Winnifred, resuming
consciousness. "It is my benefactor."</p>

<p>She would have swooned again, but the
Unknown lifted her bodily up the steps of
her home and leant her against the door.</p>

<p>"Farewell," he said, in a voice resonant with
gloom.</p>

<p>"Oh, sir!" cried the unhappy girl, "let
one who owes so much to one who has saved
her in her hour of need at least know his
name."</p>

<p>But the stranger, with a mournful gesture<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
of farewell, had disappeared as rapidly as he
had come.</p>

<p>But, as to why he had disappeared, we must
ask our reader's patience for another chapter.
<br />
<br />
</p>


<h3><a name="I_VI" id="I_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h3>

<h4>THE UNKNOWN</h4>


<p>The scene is now shifted, sideways and forwards,
so as to put it at Muddlenut Chase, and
to make it a fortnight later than the events
related in the last chapter.</p>

<p>Winnifred is now at the Chase as the guest
of the Marquis and Marchioness. There her
bruised soul finds peace.</p>

<p>The Chase itself was one of those typical
country homes which are, or were till yesterday,
the glory of England. The approach to
the Chase lay through twenty miles of glorious
forest, filled with fallow deer and wild bulls.
The house itself, dating from the time of
the Plantagenets, was surrounded by a moat
covered with broad lilies and floating green
scum. Magnificent peacocks sunned themselves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
on the terraces, while from the surrounding
shrubberies there rose the soft murmur of
doves, pigeons, bats, owls and partridges.</p>

<p>Here sat Winnifred Clair day after day
upon the terrace recovering her strength, under
the tender solicitude of the Marchioness.</p>

<p>Each day the girl urged upon her noble
hostess the necessity of her departure. "Nay,"
said the Marchioness, with gentle insistence,
"stay where you are. Your soul is bruised.
You must rest."</p>

<p>"Alas," cried Winnifred, "who am I that
I should rest? Alone, despised, buffeted by
fate, what right have I to your kindness?"</p>

<p>"Miss Clair," replied the noble lady, "wait
till you are stronger. There is something that
I wish to say to you."</p>

<p>Then at last, one morning when Winnifred's
temperature had fallen to ninety-eight point
three, the Marchioness spoke.</p>

<p>"Miss Clair," she said, in a voice which
throbbed with emotion, "Winnifred, if I may
so call you, Lord Muddlenut and I have
formed a plan for your future. It is our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
dearest wish that you should marry our
son."</p>

<p>"Alas," cried Winnifred, while tears rose
in her eyes, "it cannot be!"</p>

<p>"Say not so," cried the Marchioness. "Our
son, Lord Mordaunt Muddlenut, is young,
handsome, all that a girl could desire. After
months of wandering he returns to us this morning.
It is our dearest wish to see him married
and established. We offer you his hand."</p>

<p>"Indeed," replied Winnifred, while her tears
fell even more freely, "I seem to requite but
ill the kindness that you show. Alas, my
heart is no longer in my keeping."</p>

<p>"Where is it?" cried the Marchioness.</p>

<p>"It is another's. One whose very name I
do not know holds it in his keeping."</p>

<p>But at this moment a blithe, gladsome step
was heard upon the flagstones of the terrace.
A manly, ringing voice, which sent a thrill to
Winnifred's heart, cried "Mother!" and in
another instant Lord Mordaunt Muddlenut,
for he it was, had folded the Marchioness to
his heart.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>Winnifred rose, her heart beating wildly.
One glance was enough. The newcomer, Lord
Mordaunt, was none other than the Unknown,
the Unaccountable, to whose protection she
had twice owed her life.</p>

<p>With a wild cry Winnifred Clair leaped
across the flagstones of the terrace and fled
into the park.
<br />
<br />
</p>


<h3><a name="I_VII" id="I_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h3>

<h4>THE PROPOSAL</h4>


<p>They stood beneath the great trees of the
ancestral park, into which Lord Mordaunt had
followed Winnifred at a single bound. All
about them was the radiance of early June.</p>

<p>Lord Mordaunt knelt on one knee on the
greensward, and with a touch in which respect
and reverence were mingled with the deepest
and manliest emotion, he took between his
finger and thumb the tip of the girl's gloved
hand.</p>

<p>"Miss Clair," he uttered, in a voice suffused
with the deepest yearning, yet vibrating with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
the most profound respect, "Miss Clair&mdash;Winnifred&mdash;hear
me, I implore!"</p>

<p>"Alas," cried Winnifred, struggling in vain
to disengage the tip of her glove from the impetuous
clasp of the young nobleman, "alas,
whither can I fly? I do not know my way
through the wood, and there are bulls in all
directions. I am not used to them! Lord
Mordaunt, I implore you, let the tears of
one but little skilled in the art of dissimulation&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay, Winnifred," said the Young Earl,
"fly not. Hear me out!"</p>

<p>"Let me fly," begged the unhappy girl.</p>

<p>"You must not fly," pleaded Mordaunt.
"Let me first, here upon bended knee, convey
to you the expression of a devotion, a love, as
ardent and as deep as ever burned in a human
heart. Winnifred, be my bride!"</p>

<p>"Oh, sir," sobbed Winnifred, "if the knowledge
of a gratitude, a thankfulness from one
whose heart will ever treasure as its proudest
memory the recollection of one who did for one
all that one could have wanted done for one&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>if
this be some poor guerdon, let it suffice.
But, alas, my birth, the dark secret of my birth
forbids&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay," cried Mordaunt, leaping now to his
feet, "your birth is all right. I have looked
into it myself. It is as good&mdash;or nearly as
good&mdash;as my own. Till I knew this, my lips
were sealed by duty. While I supposed that
you had a lower birth and I an upper, I was
bound to silence. But come with me to the
house. There is one arrived with me who will
explain all."</p>

<p>Hand in hand the lovers, for such they now
were, returned to the Chase. There in the
great hall the Marquis and the Marchioness
were standing ready to greet them.</p>

<p>"My child!" exclaimed the noble lady, as
she folded Winnifred to her heart. Then she
turned to her son. "Let her know all!"
she cried.</p>

<p>Lord Mordaunt stepped across the room to
a curtain. He drew it aside, and there stepped
forth Mr. Bonehead, the old lawyer who had
cast Winnifred upon the world.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>"Miss Clair," said the Lawyer, advancing
and taking the girl's hand for a moment in a
kindly clasp, "the time has come for me to
explain all. You are not, you never were, the
penniless girl that you suppose. Under the
terms of your father's will, I was called upon
to act a part and to throw you upon the world.
It was my client's wish, and I followed it. I
told you, quite truthfully, that I had put part
of your money into options in an oil-well.
Miss Clair, that well is now producing a
million gallons of gasolene a month!'</p>

<p>"A million gallons!" cried Winnifred. "I
can never use it."</p>

<p>"Wait till you own a motor-car, Miss
Winnifred," said the Lawyer.</p>

<p>"Then I am rich!" exclaimed the bewildered
girl.</p>

<p>"Rich beyond your dreams," answered the
Lawyer. "Miss Clair, you own in your own
right about half of the State of Texas&mdash;I think
it is in Texas, at any rate either Texas or Rhode
Island, or one of those big states in America.
More than this, I have invested your property<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
since your father's death so wisely that even
after paying the income tax and the property
tax, the inheritance tax, the dog tax and the tax
on amusements, you will still have one half of
one per cent to spend."</p>

<p>Winnifred clasped her hands.</p>

<p>"I knew it all the time," said Lord Mordaunt,
drawing the girl to his embrace, "I
found it out through this good man."</p>

<p>"We knew it too," said the Marchioness.
"Can you forgive us, darling, our little plot for
your welfare? Had we not done this Mordaunt
might have had to follow you over to
America and chase you all around Newport
and Narragansett at a fearful expense."</p>

<p>"How can I thank you enough?" cried
Winnifred. Then she added eagerly, "And
my birth, my descent?"</p>

<p>"It is all right," interjected the Old Lawyer.
"It is A 1. Your father, who died before you
were born, quite a little time before, belonged
to the very highest peerage of Wales. You
are descended directly from Claer-ap-Claer,
who murdered Owen Glendower. Your mother<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
we are still tracing up. But we have already
connected her with Floyd-ap-Floyd, who
murdered Prince Llewellyn."</p>

<p>"Oh, sir," cried the grateful girl. "I only
hope I may prove worthy of them!"</p>

<p>"One thing more," said Lord Mordaunt,
and stepping over to another curtain he drew
it aside and there emerged Lord Wynchgate.</p>

<p>He stood before Winnifred, a manly contrition
struggling upon features which, but for
the evil courses of he who wore them, might
have been almost presentable.</p>

<p>"Miss Clair," he said, "I ask your pardon.
I tried to carry you off. I never will again.
But before we part let me say that my acquaintance
with you has made me a better man,
broader, bigger and, I hope, deeper."</p>

<p>With a profound bow, Lord Wynchgate
took his leave.

<h4>WEDDED AT LAST</h4>


<p>Lord Mordaunt and his bride were married
forthwith in the parish church of Muddlenut
Chase. With Winnifred's money they have
drained the moat, rebuilt the Chase, and
chased the bulls out of the park. They have
six children, so far, and are respected, honoured
and revered in the countryside far
and wide, over a radius of twenty miles in
circumference.<br />

<h2><i>JOHN AND I</i></h2>

<h3><i>OR, HOW I NEARLY LOST MY HUSBAND</i></h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Narrated after the approved fashion of the best

</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>


<p>It was after we had been married about
two years that I began to feel that I
needed more air. Every time I looked
at John across the breakfast-table, I felt
as if I must have more air, more space.</p>

<p>I seemed to feel as if I had no room to
expand. I had begun to ask myself whether
I had been wise in marrying John, whether
John was really sufficient for my development.
I felt cramped and shut in. In spite of myself
the question would arise in my mind whether
John really understood my nature. He had
a way of reading the newspaper, propped up
against the sugar-bowl, at breakfast, that
somehow made me feel as if things had gone
all wrong. It was bitter to realize that the
time had come when John could prefer the
newspaper to his wife's society.

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>But perhaps I had better go back and tell
the whole miserable story from the beginning.</p>

<p>I shall never forget&mdash;I suppose no woman
ever does&mdash;the evening when John first spoke
out his love for me. I had felt for some time
past that it was there. Again and again, he
seemed about to speak. But somehow his
words seemed to fail him. Twice I took him
into the very heart of the little wood beside
Mother's house, but it was only a small wood,
and somehow he slipped out on the other side.
"Oh, John," I had said, "how lonely and still
it seems in the wood with no one here but ourselves!
Do you think," I said, "that the birds
have souls?" "I don't know," John answered,
"let's get out of this." I was sure that his
emotion was too strong for him. "I never
feel a bit lonesome where you are, John," I
said, as we made our way among the underbrush.
"I think we can get out down that
little gully," he answered. Then one evening
in June after tea I led John down a path beside
the house to a little corner behind the garden
where there was a stone wall on one side and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
a high fence right in front of us, and thorn
bushes on the other side. There was a little
bench in the angle of the wall and the fence,
and we sat down on it.</p>

<p>"Minnie," John said, "there's something I
meant to say&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, John," I cried, and I flung my arms
round his neck. It all came with such a flood
of surprise.</p>

<p>"All I meant, Minn&mdash;&mdash;" John went on,
but I checked him.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't, John, don't say anything more,"
I said. "It's just too perfect." Then I rose
and seized him by the wrist. "Come," I said,
"come to Mother," and I rushed him along
the path.</p>

<p>As soon as Mother saw us come in hand in
hand in this way, she guessed everything. She
threw both her arms round John's neck and
fairly pinned him against the wall. John tried
to speak, but Mother wouldn't let him. "I saw
it all along, John," she said. "Don't speak.
Don't say a word. I guessed your love for
Minn from the very start. I don't know what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
I shall do without her, John, but she's yours
now; take her." Then Mother began to cry
and I couldn't help crying too. "Take him to
Father," Mother said, and we each took one of
John's wrists and took him to Father on the
back verandah. As soon as John saw Father
he tried to speak again&mdash;"I think I ought to
say," he began, but Mother stopped him.
"Father," she said, "he wants to take our
little girl away. He loves her very dearly,
Alfred," she said, "and I think it our duty to
let her go, no matter how hard it is, and oh,
please Heaven, Alfred, he'll treat her well and
not misuse her, or beat her," and she began
to sob again.</p>

<p>Father got up and took John by the hand
and shook it warmly.</p>

<p>"Take her, boy," he said. "She's all
yours now, take her."</p>

<p>So John and I were engaged, and in due time
our wedding day came and we were married.
I remember that for days and days before the
wedding day John seemed very nervous and
depressed; I think he was worrying, poor boy,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
as to whether he could really make me happy
and whether he could fill my life as it should
be filled. But I told him that he was not
to worry, because I <i>meant</i> to be happy, and
was determined just to make the best of
everything.</p>

<p>Father stayed with John a good deal before
the wedding day, and on the wedding morning
he went and fetched him to the church in a
closed carriage and had him there all ready
when we came. It was a beautiful day in
September, and the church looked just lovely.
I had a beautiful gown of white organdie with
<i>tulle</i> at the throat, and I carried a great bunch
of white roses, and Father led John up the aisle
after me.</p>

<p>I remember that Mother cried a good deal
at the wedding, and told John that he had
stolen her darling and that he must never
misuse me or beat me. And I remember that
the clergyman spoke very severely to John, and
told him he hoped he realized the responsibility
he was taking and that it was his duty to make
me happy. A lot of our old friends were there,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
and they all spoke quite sharply to John, and
all the women kissed me and said they hoped I
would never regret what I had done, and I just
kept up my spirits by sheer determination, and
told them that I had made up my mind to be
happy and that I was going to be so.</p>

<p>So presently it was all over and we were
driven to the station and got the afternoon
train for New York, and when we sat down
in the compartment among all our bandboxes
and flowers, John said, "Well, thank God,
that's over." And I said, "Oh, John, an oath!
on our wedding day, an oath!" John said,
"I'm sorry, Minn, I didn't mean&mdash;&mdash;" but I said,
"Don't, John, don't make it worse. Swear at
me if you must, but don't make it harder to
bear."</p>

<p class="tb">* * * * *</p>

<p>We spent our honeymoon in New York. At
first I had thought of going somewhere to the
great lonely woods, where I could have walked
under the great trees and felt the silence of
nature, and where John should have been my
Viking and captured me with his spear, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
where I should be his and his alone and no
other man should share me; and John had said
all right. Or else I had planned to go away
somewhere to the seashore, where I could have
watched the great waves dashing themselves
against the rocks. I had told John that he
should be my cave man, and should seize me
in his arms and carry me whither he would.
I felt somehow that for my development I
wanted to get as close to nature as ever I could&mdash;that
my mind seemed to be reaching out for
a great emptiness. But I looked over all the
hotel and steamship folders I could find and it
seemed impossible to get good accommodation,
so we came to New York. I had a great deal
of shopping to do for our new house, so I could
not be much with John, but I felt it was not
right to neglect him, so I drove him somewhere
in a taxi each morning and called for him again
in the evening. One day I took him to the
Metropolitan Museum, and another day I left
him at the Zoo, and another day at the
aquarium. John seemed very happy and quiet
among the fishes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>So presently we came back home, and I spent
many busy days in fixing and arranging our new
house. I had the drawing-room done in blue,
and the dining-room all in dark panelled wood,
and a boudoir upstairs done in pink and white
enamel to match my bedroom and dressing-room.
There was a very nice little room in the
basement next to the coal cellar that I turned
into a "den" for John, so that when he wanted
to smoke he could go down there and do it.
John seemed to appreciate his den at once, and
often would stay down there so long that I had
to call to him to come up.</p>

<p>When I look back on those days they seem
very bright and happy. But it was not very
long before a change came. I began to realize
that John was neglecting me. I noticed it at
first in small things. I don't know just how
long it was after our marriage that John began
to read the newspaper at breakfast. At first
he would only pick it up and read it in little
bits, and only on the front page. I tried not
to be hurt at it, and would go on talking just
as brightly as I could, without seeming to notice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
anything. But presently he went on to reading
the inside part of the paper, and then one day
he opened up the financial page and folded
the paper right back and leant it against the
sugar-bowl.</p>

<p>I could not but wonder whether John's love
for me was what it had been. Was it cooling?
I asked myself. And what was cooling it?
It hardly seemed possible, when I looked back
to the wild passion with which he had proposed
to me on the garden bench, that John's love
was waning. But I kept noticing different
little things. One day in the spring-time I saw
John getting out a lot of fishing tackle from a
box and fitting it together. I asked him what
he was going to do, and he said that he was
going to fish. I went to my room and had a
good cry. It seemed dreadful that he could
neglect his wife for a few worthless fish.</p>

<p>So I decided to put John to the test. It had
been my habit every morning after he put his
coat on to go to the office to let John have one
kiss, just one weeny kiss, to keep him happy all
day. So this day when he was getting ready I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
bent my head over a big bowl of flowers and
pretended not to notice. I think John must
have been hurt, as I heard him steal out on
tiptoe.</p>

<p>Well, I realized that things had come to a
dreadful state, and so I sent over to Mother,
and Mother came, and we had a good cry
together. I made up my mind to force myself
to face things and just to be as bright as ever
I could. Mother and I both thought that
things would be better if I tried all I could to
make something out of John. I have always
felt that every woman should make all that she
can out of her husband. So I did my best first
of all to straighten up John's appearance. I
shifted the style of collar he was wearing to a
tighter kind that I liked better, and I brushed
his hair straight backward instead of forward,
which gave him a much more alert look.
Mother said that John needed waking up, and
so we did all we could to wake him up. Mother
came over to stay with me a good deal, and in
the evenings we generally had a little music or
a game of cards.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>About this time another difficulty began to
come into my married life, which I suppose I
ought to have foreseen&mdash;I mean the attentions
of other gentlemen. I have always called
forth a great deal of admiration in gentlemen,
but I have always done my best to act like a
lady and to discourage it in every possible way.
I had been innocent enough to suppose that this
would end with married life, and it gave me a
dreadful shock to realize that such was not the
case. The first one I noticed was a young man
who came to the house, at an hour when John
was out, for the purpose, so he said at least,
of reading the gas meter. He looked at me in
just the boldest way and asked me to show him
the way to the cellar. I don't know whether
it was a pretext or not, but I just summoned all
the courage I had and showed him to the head
of the cellar stairs. I had determined that if
he tried to carry me down with him I would
scream for the servants, but I suppose something
in my manner made him desist, and he
went alone. When he came up he professed
to have read the meter and he left the house<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
quite quietly. But I thought it wiser to say
nothing to John of what had happened.</p>

<p>There were others too. There was a young
man with large brown eyes who came and said
he had been sent to tune the piano. He came
on three separate days, and he bent his ear over
the keys in such a mournful way that I knew
he must have fallen in love with me. On the
last day he offered to tune my harp for a dollar
extra, but I refused, and when I asked him
instead to tune Mother's mandoline he said he
didn't know how. Of course I told John
nothing of all this.</p>

<p>Then there was Mr. McQueen, who came
to the house several times to play cribbage with
John. He had been desperately in love with
me years before&mdash;at least I remember his taking
me home from a hockey match once, and what
a struggle it was for him not to come into the
parlour and see Mother for a few minutes when
I asked him; and, though he was married now
and with three children, I felt sure when he
came to play cribbage with John that it <i>meant</i>
something. He was very discreet and honour<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>able,
and never betrayed himself for a moment,
and I acted my part as if there was nothing at
all behind. But one night, when he came over
to play and John had had to go out, he refused
to stay even for an instant. He had got his
overshoes off before I told him that John was
out, and asked him if he wouldn't come into
the parlour and hear Mother play the mandoline,
but he just made one dive for his overshoes
and was gone. I knew that he didn't dare to
trust himself.</p>

<p>Then presently a new trouble came. I
began to suspect that John was drinking. I
don't mean for a moment that he was drunk,
or that he was openly cruel to me. But at
times he seemed to act so queerly, and I noticed
that one night when by accident I left a bottle
of raspberry vinegar on the sideboard overnight,
it was all gone in the morning. Two
or three times when McQueen and John were
to play cribbage, John would fetch home two
or three bottles of bevo with him and they
would sit sipping all evening.</p>

<p>I think he was drinking bevo by himself,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
too, though I could never be sure of it. At any
rate he often seemed queer and restless in the
evenings, and instead of staying in his den he
would wander all over the house. Once we
heard him&mdash;I mean Mother and I and two lady
friends who were with us that evening&mdash;quite
late (after ten o'clock) apparently moving
about in the pantry. "John," I called, "is
that you?" "Yes, Minn," he answered, quietly
enough, I admit. "What are you doing
there?" I asked. "Looking for something to
eat," he said. "John," I said, "you are forgetting
what is due to me as your wife. You
were fed at six. Go back."</p>

<p>He went. But yet I felt more and more
that his love must be dwindling to make him act
as he did. I thought it all over wearily enough
and asked myself whether I had done everything
I should to hold my husband's love. I
had kept him in at nights. I had cut down his
smoking. I had stopped his playing cards.
What more was there that I could do?</p>

<p class="tb">* * * * *</p>

<p>So at last the conviction came to me that I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
must go away. I felt that I must get away
somewhere and think things out. At first I
thought of Palm Beach, but the season had not
opened and I felt somehow that I couldn't wait.
I wanted to get away somewhere by myself
and just face things as they were. So one
morning I said to John, "John, I think I'd like
to go off somewhere for a little time, just to be
by myself, dear, and I don't want you to ask
to come with me or to follow me, but just let
me go." John said, "All right, Minn. When
are you going to start?" The cold brutality
of it cut me to the heart, and I went upstairs
and had a good cry and looked over steamship
and railroad folders. I thought of Havana
for a while, because the pictures of the harbour
and the castle and the queer Spanish streets
looked so attractive, but then I was afraid
that at Havana a woman alone by herself might
be simply persecuted by attentions from gentlemen.
They say the Spanish temperament
is something fearful. So I decided on Bermuda
instead. I felt that in a beautiful, quiet
place like Bermuda I could think everything all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
over and face things, and it said on the folder
that there were always at least two English
regiments in garrison there, and the English
officers, whatever their faults, always treat a
woman with the deepest respect.</p>

<p>So I said nothing more to John, but in the
next few days I got all my arrangements made
and my things packed. And when the last
afternoon came I sat down and wrote John a
long letter, to leave on my boudoir table, telling
him that I had gone to Bermuda. I told him
that I wanted to be alone: I said that I couldn't
tell when I would be back&mdash;that it might be
months, or it might be years, and I hoped that
he would try to be as happy as he could and
forget me entirely, and to send me money on
the first of every month.</p>

<p class="tb">* * * * *</p>

<p>Well, it was just at that moment that one of
those strange coincidences happen, little things
in themselves, but which seem to alter the whole
course of a person's life. I had nearly finished
the letter to John that I was to leave on the
writing-desk, when just then the maid came up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
to my room with a telegram. It was for John,
but I thought it my duty to open it and read
it for him before I left. And I nearly fainted
when I saw that it was from a lawyer in Bermuda&mdash;of
all places&mdash;and it said that a legacy
of two hundred thousand dollars had been left
to John by an uncle of his who had died there,
and asking for instructions about the disposition
of it.</p>

<p>A great wave seemed to sweep over me, and
all the wicked thoughts that had been in my
mind&mdash;for I saw now that they <i>were</i> wicked&mdash;were
driven clean away. I thought how completely
lost poor old John would feel if all this
money came to him and he didn't have to work
any more and had no one at his side to help and
guide him in using it.</p>

<p>I tore up the wicked letter I had written, and
I hurried as fast as I could to pack up a valise
with John's things (my own were packed
already, as I said). Then presently John came
in, and I broke the news to him as gently and as
tenderly as I could about his uncle having left
him the money and having died. I told him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
that I had found out all about the trains and
the Bermuda steamer, and had everything all
packed and ready for us to leave at once. John
seemed a little dazed about it all, and kept
saying that his uncle had taught him to play
tennis when he was a little boy, and he was very
grateful and thankful to me for having everything
arranged, and thought it wonderful.</p>

<p>I had time to telephone to a few of my
women friends, and they just managed to rush
round for a few minutes to say good-bye. I
couldn't help crying a little when I told them
about John's uncle dying so far away with none
of us near him, and I told them about the legacy,
and they cried a little to hear of it all; and when
I told them that John and I might not come
back direct from Bermuda, but might take a
run over to Europe first, they all cried some
more.</p>

<p>We left for New York that evening, and
after we had been to Bermuda and arranged
about a suitable monument for John's uncle
and collected the money, we sailed for
Europe.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>All through the happy time that has followed,
I like to think that through all our trials and
difficulties affliction brought us safely together
at last.

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>


<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<p>"The fate of England hangs upon it,"
murmured Sir John Elphinspoon, as
he sank wearily into an armchair.
For a moment, as he said "England,"
the baronet's eye glistened and his ears lifted
as if in defiance, but as soon as he stopped
saying it his eye lost its brilliance and
his ears dropped wearily at the sides of his
head.</p>

<p>Lady Elphinspoon looked at her husband
anxiously. She could not conceal from herself
that his face, as he sank into his chair, seemed
somehow ten years older than it had been ten
years ago.</p>

<p>"You are home early, John?" she queried.</p>

<p>"The House rose early, my dear," said the
baronet.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
"For the All England Ping-Pong match?"</p>

<p>"No, for the Dog Show. The Prime
Minister felt that the Cabinet ought to attend.
He said that their presence there would help
to bind the colonies to us. I understand also
that he has a pup in the show himself. He
took the Cabinet with him."</p>

<p>"And why not you?" asked Lady Elphinspoon.</p>

<p>"You forget, my dear," said the baronet,
"as Foreign Secretary my presence at a Dog
Show might be offensive to the Shah of Persia.
Had it been a Cat Show&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The baronet paused and shook his head in
deep gloom.</p>

<p>"John," said his wife, "I feel that there is
something more. Did anything happen at the
House?"</p>

<p>Sir John nodded.</p>

<p>"A bad business," he said. "The Wazuchistan
Boundary Bill was read this afternoon
for the third time."</p>

<p>No woman in England, so it was generally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
said, had a keener political insight than Lady
Elphinspoon.</p>

<p>"The third time," she repeated thoughtfully,
"and how many more will it have to go?"</p>

<p>Sir John turned his head aside and groaned.</p>

<p>"You are faint," exclaimed Lady Elphinspoon,
"let me ring for tea."</p>

<p>The baronet shook his head.</p>

<p>"An egg, John&mdash;let me beat you up an egg."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," murmured Sir John, still
abstracted, "beat it, yes, do beat it."</p>

<p>Lady Elphinspoon, in spite of her elevated
position as the wife of the Foreign Secretary
of Great Britain, held it not beneath her to
perform for her husband the plainest household
service. She rang for an egg. The
butler broke it for her into a tall goblet filled
with old sherry, and the noble lady, with her
own hands, beat the stuff out of it. For the
veteran politician, whose official duties rarely
allowed him to eat, an egg was a sovereign
remedy. Taken either in a goblet of sherry
or in a mug of rum, or in half a pint of
whisky, it never failed to revive his energies.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>The effect of the egg was at once visible in
the brightening of his eye and the lengthening
of his ears.</p>

<p>"And now explain to me," said his wife,
"what has happened. What <i>is</i> this Boundary
Bill?"</p>

<p>"We never meant it to pass," said Sir John.
"It was introduced only as a sop to public
opinion. It delimits our frontier in such a way
as to extend our suzerainty over the entire
desert of El Skrub. The Wazoos have claimed
that this is their desert. The hill tribes are
restless. If we attempt to advance the Wazoos
will rise. If we retire it deals a blow at our
prestige."</p>

<p>Lady Elphinspoon shuddered. Her long
political training had taught her that nothing
was so fatal to England as to be hit in the
prestige.</p>

<p>"And on the other hand," continued Sir
John, "if we move sideways, the Ohul&icirc;s, the
mortal enemies of the Wazoos, will strike us
in our rear."</p>

<p>"In our rear!" exclaimed Lady Elphin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>spoon
in a tone of pain. "Oh, John, we must
go forward. Take another egg."</p>

<p>"We cannot," groaned the Foreign Secretary.
"There are reasons which I cannot explain
even to you, Caroline, reasons of State,
which absolutely prevent us from advancing
into Wazuchistan. Our hands are tied. Meantime
if the Wazoos rise, it is all over with us.
It will split the Cabinet."</p>

<p>"Split the Cabinet!" repeated Lady Elphinspoon
in alarm. She well knew that next to a
blow in the prestige the splitting of the Cabinet
was about the worst thing that could happen
to Great Britain. "Oh, John, they <i>must</i> be
held together at all costs. Can nothing be
done?"</p>

<p>"Everything is being done that can be. The
Prime Minister has them at the Dog Show
at this moment. To-night the Chancellor is
taking them to moving pictures. And to-morrow&mdash;it
is a State secret, my dear, but it
will be very generally known in the morning&mdash;we
have seats for them all at the circus. If
we can hold them together all is well, but if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
they split we are undone. Meantime our difficulties
increase. At the very passage of the
Bill itself a question was asked by one of the
new labour members, a miner, my dear, a quite
uneducated man&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes?" queried Lady Elphinspoon.</p>

<p>"He asked the Colonial Secretary"&mdash;Sir
John shuddered&mdash;"to tell him where Wazuchistan
is. Worse than that, my dear," added
Sir John, "he defied him to tell him where it is."</p>

<p>"What did you do? Surely he has no right
to information of that sort?"</p>

<p>"It was a close shave. Luckily the Whips
saved us. They got the Secretary out of the
House and rushed him to the British Museum.
When he got back he said that he would answer
the question a month from Friday. We got
a great burst of cheers, but it was a close thing.
But stop, I must speak at once with Powers.
My despatch box, yes, here it is. Now where
is young Powers? There is work for him to
do at once."</p>

<p>"Mr. Powers is in the conservatory with
Angela," said Lady Elphinspoon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>"With Angela!" exclaimed Sir John, while
a slight shade of displeasure appeared upon his
brow. "With Angela again! Do you think
it quite proper, my dear, that Powers should
be so constantly with Angela?"</p>

<p>"John," said his wife, "you forget, I think,
who Mr. Powers is. I am sure that Angela
knows too well what is due to her rank, and to
herself, to consider Mr. Powers anything more
than an instructive companion. And I notice
that, since Mr. Powers has been your secretary,
Angela's mind is much keener. Already the
girl has a wonderful grasp on foreign policy.
Only yesterday I heard her asking the Prime
Minister at luncheon whether we intend to
extend our Senegambian protectorate over the
Fusees. He was delighted."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well, very well," said Sir John.
Then he rang a bell for a manservant.</p>

<p>"Ask Mr. Powers," he said, "to be good
enough to attend me in the library."
<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>


<p>Angela Elphinspoon stood with Perriton
Powers among the begonias of the conservatory.
The same news which had so agitated
Sir John lay heavy on both their hearts.</p>

<p>"Will the Wazoo rise?" asked Angela,
clasping her hands before her, while her great
eyes sought the young man's face and found it.
"Oh, Mr. Powers! Tell me, will they rise?
It seems too dreadful to contemplate. Do you
think the Wazoo will rise?"</p>

<p>"It is only too likely," said Powers. They
stood looking into one another's eyes, their
thoughts all on the Wazoo.</p>

<p>Angelina Elphinspoon, as she stood there
against the background of the begonias, made
a picture that a painter, or even a plumber,
would have loved. Tall and typically English
in her fair beauty, her features, in repose, had
something of the hauteur and distinction of her
mother, and when in motion they recalled her
father.</p>

<p>Perriton Powers was even taller than Angela.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
The splendid frame and stern features of Sir
John's secretary made him a striking figure.
Yet he was, quite frankly, sprung from the
people, and made no secret of it. His father
had been simply a well-to-do London surgeon,
who had been knighted for some mere discoveries
in science. His grandfather, so it
was whispered, had been nothing more than a
successful banker who had amassed a fortune
simply by successful banking. Yet at Oxford
young Powers had carried all before him. He
had occupied a seat, a front seat, in one of the
boats, had got his blue and his pink, and had
taken a double final in Sanscrit and Arithmetic.</p>

<p>He had already travelled widely in the East,
spoke Urdu and Hoodoo with facility, while as
secretary to Sir John Elphinspoon, with a seat
in the House in prospect, he had his foot upon
the ladder of success.</p>

<p>"Yes," repeated Powers thoughtfully, "they
may rise. Our confidential despatches tell us
that for some time they have been secretly
passing round packets of yeast. The whole
tribe is in a ferment."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>"But our sphere of influence is at stake,"
exclaimed Angela.</p>

<p>"It is," said Powers. "As a matter of fact,
for over a year we have been living on a mere
<i>modus vivendi</i>."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Powers," cried Angela, "what a
way to live."</p>

<p>"We have tried everything," said the secretary.
"We offered the Wazoo a condominium
over the desert of El Skrub. They refused it."</p>

<p>"But it's our desert," said Angela proudly.</p>

<p>"It is. But what can we do? The best we
can hope is that El Boob will acquiesce in the
<i>status quo</i>."</p>

<p>At that moment a manservant appeared in
the doorway of the conservatory.</p>

<p>"Mr. Powers, sir," he said, "Sir John desires
your attendance, sir, in the library, sir."</p>

<p>Powers turned to Angela, a new seriousness
upon his face.</p>

<p>"Miss Elphinspoon," he said, "I think I
know what is coming. Will you wait for me
here? I shall be back in half an hour."</p>

<p>"I will wait," said the girl. She sat down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
and waited among the begonias, her mind still
on the Wazoo, her whole intense nature strung
to the highest pitch. "Can the <i>modus vivendi</i>
hold?" she murmured.</p>

<p>In half an hour Powers returned. He was
wearing now his hat and light overcoat, and
carried on a strap round his neck a tin box with
a white painted label, "<i>British Foreign Office.
Confidential Despatches. This Side Up With
Care.</i>"</p>

<p>"Miss Elphinspoon," he said, and there was
a new note in his voice, "Angela, I leave
England to-night&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To-night!" gasped Angela.</p>

<p>"On a confidential mission."</p>

<p>"To Wazuchistan!" exclaimed the girl.</p>

<p>Powers paused a moment. "To Wazuchistan,"
he said, "yes. But it must not be
known. I shall return in a month&mdash;or never.
If I fail"&mdash;he spoke with an assumed lightness&mdash;"it
is only one more grave among the hills. If
I succeed, the Cabinet is saved, and with it the
destiny of England."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Powers," cried Angela, rising and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
advancing towards him, "how splendid! How
noble! No reward will be too great for you."</p>

<p>"My reward," said Powers, and as he spoke
he reached out and clasped both of the girl's
hands in his own, "yes, my reward. May I
come and claim it here?"</p>

<p>For a moment he looked straight into her
eyes. In the next he was gone, and Angela
was alone.</p>

<p>"His reward!" she murmured. "What
could he have meant? His reward that he is to
claim. What can it be?"</p>

<p>But she could not divine it. She admitted
to herself that she had not the faintest idea.
<br />
<br />
</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

<p>In the days that followed all England was
thrilled to its base as the news spread that the
Wazoo might rise at any moment.</p>

<p>"Will the Wazoos rise?" was the question
upon every lip.</p>

<p>In London men went to their offices with a
sense of gloom. At lunch they could hardly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
eat. A feeling of impending disaster pervaded
all ranks.</p>

<p>Sir John as he passed to and fro to the
House was freely accosted in the streets.</p>

<p>"Will the Wazoos rise, sir?" asked an
honest labourer. "Lord help us all, sir, if they
do."</p>

<p>Sir John, deeply touched, dropped a shilling
in the honest fellow's hat, by accident.</p>

<p>At No. 10 Downing Street, women of the
working class, with children in their arms, stood
waiting for news.</p>

<p>On the Exchange all was excitement.
Consols fell two points in twenty-four hours.
Even raising the Bank rate and shutting the
door brought only a temporary relief.</p>

<p>Lord Glump, the greatest financial expert in
London, was reported as saying that if the
Wazoos rose England would be bankrupt in
forty-eight hours.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, to the consternation of the whole
nation, the Government did nothing. The
Cabinet seemed to be paralysed.</p>

<p>On the other hand the Press became all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
more clamorous. The London <i>Times</i> urged
that an expedition should be sent at once.
Twenty-five thousand household troops, it
argued, should be sent up the Euphrates or up
the Ganges or up something without delay.
If they were taken in flat boats, carried over
the mountains on mules, and lifted across the
rivers in slings, they could then be carried over
the desert on jackasses. They could reach
Wazuchistan in two years. Other papers
counselled moderation. The <i>Manchester
Guardian</i> recalled the fact that the Wazoos
were a Christian people. Their leader, El
Boob, so it was said, had accepted Christianity
with childlike simplicity and had asked if there
was any more of it. The <i>Spectator</i> claimed
that the Wazoos, or more properly the Wazi,
were probably the descendants of an Iranic or
perhaps Urgumic stock. It suggested the
award of a Rhodes Scholarship. It looked
forward to the days when there would be
Wazoos at Oxford. Even the presence of a
single Wazoo, or, more accurately, a single
Wooz, would help.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>With each day the news became more
ominous. It was reported in the Press that a
Wazoo, inflamed apparently with <i>ghee</i>, or perhaps
with <i>bhong</i>, had rushed up to the hills and
refused to come down. It was said that the
Shriek-el-Foozlum, the religious head of the
tribe, had torn off his suspenders and sent
them to Mecca.</p>

<p>That same day the <i>Illustrated London
News</i> published a drawing "Wazoo Warriors
Crossing a River and Shouting, Ho!"
and the general consternation reached its
height.</p>

<p>Meantime, for Sir John and his colleagues,
the question of the hour became, "Could the
Cabinet be held together?" Every effort was
made. The news that the Cabinet had all been
seen together at the circus, for a moment reassured
the nation. But the rumour spread
that the First Lord of the Admiralty had said
that the clowns were a bum lot. The Radical
Press claimed that if he thought so he ought
to resign.</p>

<p>On the fatal Friday the question already<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
referred to was scheduled for its answer. The
friends of the Government counted on the
answer to restore confidence. To the consternation
of all, the expected answer was not
forthcoming. The Colonial Secretary rose in
his place, visibly nervous. Ministers, he said,
had been asked where Wazuchistan was. They
were not prepared, at the present delicate stage
of negotiations, to say. More hung upon the
answer than Ministers were entitled to divulge.
They could only appeal to the patriotism of the
nation. He could only say this, that <i>wherever</i>
it was, and he used the word <i>wherever</i> with all
the emphasis of which he was capable, the
Government would accept the full responsibility
for its being where it was.</p>

<p>The House adjourned in something like
confusion.</p>

<p>Among those seated behind the grating of
the Ladies' Gallery was Lady Elphinspoon.
Her quick instinct told her the truth. Driving
home, she found her husband seated, crushed,
in his library.</p>

<p>"John," she said, falling on her knees and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
taking her husband's hands in hers, "is this
true? Is this the dreadful truth?"</p>

<p>"I see you have divined it, Caroline," said
the statesman sadly. "It is the truth. We
don't know where Wazuchistan is."</p>

<p>For a moment there was silence.</p>

<p>"But, John, how could it have happened?"</p>

<p>"We thought the Colonial Office knew. We
were confident that they knew. The Colonial
Secretary had stated that he had been there.
Later on it turned out that he meant Saskatchewan.
Of course they thought <i>we</i> knew. And
we both thought that the Exchequer must
know. We understood that they had collected
a hut tax for ten years."</p>

<p>"And hadn't they?"</p>

<p>"Not a penny. The Wazoos live in tents."</p>

<p>"But, surely," pleaded Lady Elphinspoon,
"you could find out. Had you no maps?"</p>

<p>Sir John shook his head.</p>

<p>"We thought of that at once, my dear.
We've looked all through the British Museum.
Once we thought we had succeeded. But it
turned out to be Wisconsin."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>"But the map in the <i>Times</i>? Everybody
saw it."</p>

<p>Again the baronet shook his head. "Lord
Southcliff had it made in the office," he said.
"It appears that he always does. Otherwise
the physical features might not suit him."</p>

<p>"But could you not send some one to see?"</p>

<p>"We did. We sent Perriton Powers to
find out where it was. We had a month to the
good. It was barely time, just time. Powers
has failed and we are lost. To-morrow all
England will guess the truth and the Government
falls."
<br />

</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<p>The crowd outside of No. 10 Downing
Street that evening was so dense that all traffic
was at a standstill. But within the historic
room where the Cabinet were seated about the
long table all was calm. Few could have
guessed from the quiet demeanour of the
group of statesmen that the fate of an Empire
hung by a thread.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>Seated at the head of the table, the Prime
Minister was quietly looking over a book of
butterflies, while waiting for the conference to
begin. Beside him the Secretary for Ireland
was fixing trout flies, while the Chancellor of
the Exchequer kept his serene face bent over
upon his needlework. At the Prime Minister's
right, Sir John Elphinspoon, no longer agitated,
but sustained and dignified by the responsibility
of his office, was playing spillikins.</p>

<p>The little clock on the mantel chimed eight.</p>

<p>The Premier closed his book of butterflies.</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen," he said, "I fear our
meeting will not be a protracted one. It seems
we are hopelessly at variance. You, Sir
Charles," he continued, turning to the First
Sea Lord, who was in attendance, "are still in
favour of a naval expedition?"</p>

<p>"Send it up at once," said Sir Charles.</p>

<p>"Up where?" asked the Premier.</p>

<p>"Up anything," answered the Old Sea Dog,
"it will get there."</p>

<p>Voices of dissent were raised in undertones
around the table.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>"I strongly deprecate any expedition," said
the Chancellor of the Exchequer, "I favour
a convention with the Shriek. Let the Shriek
sign a convention recognizing the existence of a
supreme being and receiving from us a million
sterling in acknowledgment."</p>

<p>"And where will you <i>find</i> the Shriek?" said
the Prime Minister. "Come, come, gentlemen,
I fear that we can play this comedy no
longer. The truth is," he added with characteristic
nonchalance, "we don't know where the
bally place is. We can't meet the House to-*morrow.
We are hopelessly split. Our existence
as a Government is at an end."</p>

<p>But, at that very moment, a great noise of
shouting and clamour rose from the street
without. The Prime Minister lifted his hand
for silence. "Listen," he said. One of the
Ministers went to a window and opened it, and
the cries outside became audible. "A King's
Messenger! Make way for the King's
Messenger!"</p>

<p>The Premier turned quietly to Sir John.</p>

<p>"Perriton Powers," he said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>In another moment Perriton Powers stood
before the Ministers.</p>

<p>Bronzed by the tropic sun, his face was
recognizable only by the assured glance of his
eye. An Afghan <i>bernous</i> was thrown back
from his head and shoulders, while his commanding
figure was draped in a long <i>chibuok</i>.
A pair of pistols and a curved <i>yasmak</i> were in
his belt.</p>

<p>"So you got to Wazuchistan all right," said
the Premier quietly.</p>

<p>"I went in by way of the Barooda," said
Powers. "For many days I was unable to
cross it. The waters of the river were wild
and swollen with rains. To cross it seemed
certain death&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But at last you got over," said the Premier,
"and then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I struck out over the Fahuri desert. For
days and days, blinded by the sun, and almost
buried in sand, I despaired."</p>

<p>"But you got through it all right. And after
that?"</p>

<p>"My first care was to disguise myself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
Staining myself from head to foot with betel
nut&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To look like a beetle," said the Premier.
"Exactly. And so you got to Wazuchistan.
Where is it and what is it?"</p>

<p>"My lord," said Powers, drawing himself
up and speaking with emphasis, "I got to where
it was thought to be. There is no such place!"</p>

<p>The whole Cabinet gave a start of astonishment.</p>

<p>"No such place!" they repeated.</p>

<p>"What about El Boob?" asked the Chancellor.</p>

<p>"There is no such person."</p>

<p>"And the Shriek-el-Foozlum?"</p>

<p>Powers shook his head.</p>

<p>"But do you mean to say," said the Premier
in astonishment, "that there are no Wazoos?
There you <i>must</i> be wrong. True we don't just
know where they are. But our despatches
have shown too many signs of active trouble
traced directly to the Wazoos to disbelieve in
them. There are Wazoos somewhere, there&mdash;there
<i>must</i> be."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Wazoos," said Powers, "are there.
But they are Irish. So are the Ohul&icirc;s. They
are both Irish."</p>

<p>"But how the devil did they get out there?"
questioned the Premier. "And why did they
make the trouble?"</p>

<p>"The Irish, my lord," interrupted the Chief
Secretary for Ireland, "are everywhere, and it
is their business to make trouble."</p>

<p>"Some years ago," continued Powers, "a few
Irish families settled out there. The Ohul&icirc;s
should be properly called the O'Hooleys.
The word Wazoo is simply the Urdu for
McGinnis. El Boob is the Urdu for the
Arabic El Papa, the Pope. It was my
knowledge of Urdu, itself an agglutinative
language&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Precisely," said the Premier. Then he
turned to his Cabinet. "Well, gentlemen, our
task is now simplified. If they are Irish, I
think we know exactly what to do. I suppose,"
he continued, turning to Powers, "that they
want some kind of Home Rule."</p>

<p>"They do," said Powers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>"Separating, of course, the Ohul&icirc; counties
from the Wazoo?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Powers.</p>

<p>"Precisely; the thing is simplicity itself.
And what contribution will they make to the
Imperial Exchequer?"</p>

<p>"None."</p>

<p>"And will they pay their own expenses?"</p>

<p>"They refuse to."</p>

<p>"Exactly. All this is plain sailing. Of
course they must have a constabulary. Lord
Edward," continued the Premier, turning now
to the Secretary of War, "how long will it take
to send in a couple of hundred constabulary?
I think they'll expect it, you know. It's their
right."</p>

<p>"Let me see," said Lord Edward, calculating
quickly, with military precision, "sending them
over the Barooda in buckets and then over the
mountains in baskets&mdash;I think in about two
weeks."</p>

<p>"Good," said the Premier. "Gentlemen, we
shall meet the House to-morrow. Sir John,
will you meantime draft us an annexation bill?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
And you, young man, what you have done is
really not half bad. His Majesty will see you
to-morrow. I am glad that you are safe."</p>

<p>"On my way home," said Powers, with quiet
modesty, "I was attacked by a lion&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you beat it off," said the Premier.
"Exactly. Good night."
<br />
<br />
</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>


<p>It was on the following afternoon that
Sir John Elphinspoon presented the Wazoo
Annexation Bill to a crowded and breathless
House.</p>

<p>Those who know the House of Commons
know that it has its moods. At times it is
grave, earnest, thoughtful. At other times it
is swept with emotion which comes at it in
waves. Or at times, again, it just seems to
sit there as if it were stuffed.</p>

<p>But all agreed that they had never seen the
House so hushed as when Sir John Elphinspoon
presented his Bill for the Annexation of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
Wazuchistan. And when at the close of a
splendid peroration he turned to pay a graceful
compliment to the man who had saved the
nation, and thundered forth to the delighted
ears of his listeners&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>Arma virumque cano Wazoo qui primus ab
oris</i>,</p>

<p>and then, with the words "England, England,"
still on his lips, fell over backwards and was
carried out on a stretcher, the House broke
into wild and unrestrained applause.
<br />
<br />
</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>


<p>The next day Sir Perriton Powers&mdash;for the
King had knighted him after breakfast&mdash;stood
again in the conservatory of the house in
Carlton Terrace.</p>

<p>"I have come for my reward," he said. "Do
I get it?"</p>

<p>"You do," said Angela.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Perriton clasped her in his arms.</p>

<p>"On my way home," he said, "I was attacked
by a lion. I tried to beat it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush, dearest," she whispered, "let me
take you to father."

<h3><a name="IV_I" id="IV_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h3>

<h4>HE DINED WITH ME LAST NIGHT</h4>


<p>The afternoon edition of the <i>Metropolitan
Planet</i> was going to press. Five
thousand copies a minute were reeling
off its giant cylinders. A square acre
of paper was passing through its presses every
hour. In the huge <i>Planet</i> building, which
dominated Broadway, employ&eacute;s, compositors,
reporters, advertisers, surged to and fro. Placed
in a single line (only, of course, they wouldn't
be likely to consent to it) they would have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
reached across Manhattan Island. Placed in
two lines, they would probably have reached
twice as far. Arranged in a procession they
would have taken an hour in passing a saloon:
easily that.</p>

<p>In the whole vast building all was uproar.
Telephones, megaphones and gramophones
were ringing throughout the building. Elevators
flew up and down, stopping nowhere.</p>

<p>Only in one place was quiet&mdash;namely, in the
room where sat the big man on whose capacious
intellect the whole organization depended.</p>

<p>Masterman Throgton, the general manager
of the <i>Planet</i>, was a man in middle life. There
was something in his massive frame which
suggested massiveness, and a certain quality in
the poise of his great head which indicated a
balanced intellect. His face was impenetrable
and his expression imponderable.</p>

<p>The big chief was sitting in his swivel chair
with ink all round him. Through this man's
great brain passed all the threads and filaments
that held the news of a continent. Snap one,
and the whole continent would stop.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>At the moment when our story opens (there
was no sense in opening it sooner), a written
message had just been handed in.</p>

<p>The Chief read it. He seemed to grasp its
contents in a flash.</p>

<p>"Good God!" he exclaimed. It was the
strongest expression that this solid, self-contained,
semi-detached man ever allowed himself.
Anything stronger would have seemed
too near to profanity. "Good God!" he repeated,
"Kivas Kelly murdered! In his own
home! Why, he dined with me last night!
I drove him home!"</p>

<p>For a brief moment the big man remained
plunged in thought. But with Throgton the
moment of musing was short. His instinct
was to act.</p>

<p>"You may go," he said to the messenger.
Then he seized the telephone that stood beside
him (this man could telephone almost without
stopping thinking) and spoke into it in quiet,
measured tones, without wasting a word.</p>

<p>"Hullo, operator! Put me through to two,
two, two, two, two. Is that two, two, two,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
two, two? Hullo, two, two, two, two, two; I
want Transome Kent. Kent speaking? Kent,
this is Throgton speaking. Kent, a murder
has been committed at the Kelly residence,
Riverside Drive. I want you to go and cover
it. Get it all. Don't spare expense. The
<i>Planet</i> is behind you. Have you got car-fare?
Right."</p>

<p>In another moment the big chief had turned
round in his swivel chair (at least forty degrees)
and was reading telegraphic despatches from
Jerusalem. That was the way he did things.</p>

<h3><a name="IV_II" id="IV_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h3>

<h4>I MUST SAVE HER LIFE</h4>

<p>Within a few minutes Transome Kent had
leapt into a car (a surface car) and was speeding
north towards Riverside Drive with the
full power of the car. As he passed uptown
a newsboy was already calling, "Club Man
Murdered! Another Club Man Murdered!"
Carelessly throwing a cent to the boy, Kent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
purchased a paper and read the brief notice of
the tragedy.</p>

<p>Kivas Kelly, a well-known club man and <i>bon
vivant</i>, had been found dead in his residence
on Riverside Drive, with every indication&mdash;or,
at least, with a whole lot of indications&mdash;of
murder. The unhappy club man had been
found, fully dressed in his evening clothes, lying
on his back on the floor of the billiard-room,
with his feet stuck up on the edge of the table.
A narrow black scarf, presumably his evening
tie, was twisted tightly about his neck by means
of a billiard cue inserted in it. There was a
quiet smile upon his face. He had apparently
died from strangulation. A couple of bullet-holes
passed through his body, one on each side,
but they went out again. His suspenders were
burst at the back. His hands were folded
across his chest. One of them still held a
white billiard ball. There was no sign of a
struggle or of any disturbance in the room. A
square piece of cloth was missing from the
victim's dinner jacket.</p>

<p>In its editorial columns the same paper dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>cussed
the more general aspects of the murder.
This, it said, was the third club man murdered
in the last fortnight. While not taking an
alarmist view, the paper felt that the killing of
club men had got to stop. There was a limit,
a reasonable limit, to everything. Why should
a club man be killed? It might be asked, why
should a club man live? But this was hardly
to the point. They do live. After all, to be
fair, what does a club man ask of society? Not
much. Merely wine, women and singing.
Why not let him have them? Is it fair to kill
him? Does the gain to literature outweigh the
social wrong? The writer estimated that at
the rate of killing now going on the club men
would be all destroyed in another generation.
Something should be done to conserve them.</p>

<p>Transome Kent was not a detective. He
was a reporter. After sweeping everything at
Harvard in front of him, and then behind him,
he had joined the staff of the <i>Planet</i> two
months before. His rise had been phenomenal.
In his first week of work he had unravelled a
mystery, in his second he had unearthed a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
packing scandal which had poisoned the food of
the entire nation for ten years, and in his third
he had pitilessly exposed some of the best
and most respectable people in the metropolis.
Kent's work on the <i>Planet</i> consisted now
almost exclusively of unravelling and unearthing,
and it was natural that the manager should
turn to him.</p>

<p>The mansion was a handsome sandstone
residence, standing in its own grounds. On
Kent's arrival he found that the police had
already drawn a cordon around it with cords.
Groups of morbid curiosity-seekers hung about
it in twos and threes, some of them in fours
and fives. Policemen were leaning against the
fence in all directions. They wore that baffled
look so common to the detective force of the
metropolis. "It seems to me," remarked one
of them to the man beside him, "that there is
an inexorable chain of logic about this that I
am unable to follow." "So do I," said the
other.</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector of the Detective Department,
a large, heavy-looking man, was standing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
beside a gate-post. He nodded gloomily to
Transome Kent.</p>

<p>"Are you baffled, Edwards?" asked Kent.</p>

<p>"Baffled again, Mr. Kent," said the Inspector,
with a sob in his voice. "I thought
I could have solved this one, but I can't."</p>

<p>He passed a handkerchief across his eyes.</p>

<p>"Have a cigar, Chief," said Kent, "and let
me hear what the trouble is."</p>

<p>The Inspector brightened. Like all policemen,
he was simply crazy over cigars. "All
right, Mr. Kent," he said, "wait till I chase
away the morbid curiosity-seekers."</p>

<p>He threw a stick at them.</p>

<p>"Now, then," continued Kent, "what about
tracks, footmarks? Had you thought of them?"</p>

<p>"Yes, first thing. The whole lawn is
covered with them, all stamped down. Look
at these, for instance. These are the tracks of
a man with a wooden leg"&mdash;Kent nodded&mdash;"in
all probability a sailor, newly landed from
Java, carrying a Singapore walking-stick, and
with a tin-whistle tied round his belt."</p>

<p>"Yes, I see that," said Kent thoughtfully.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
"The weight of the whistle weighs him down
a little on the right side."</p>

<p>"Do you think, Mr. Kent, a sailor from
Java with a wooden leg would commit a murder
like this?" asked the Inspector eagerly.
"Would he do it?"</p>

<p>"He would," said the Investigator. "They
generally do&mdash;as soon as they land."</p>

<p>The Inspector nodded. "And look at these
marks here, Mr. Kent. You recognize them,
surely&mdash;those are the footsteps of a bar-keeper
out of employment, waiting for the eighteenth
amendment to pass away. See how deeply they
sink in&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Kent, "he'd commit murder."</p>

<p>"There are lots more," continued the Inspector,
"but they're no good. The morbid
curiosity-seekers were walking all over this
place while we were drawing the cordon
round it."</p>

<p>"Stop a bit," said Kent, pausing to think a
moment. "What about thumb-prints?"</p>

<p>"Thumb-prints," said the Inspector. "Don't
mention them. The house is full of them."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>"Any thumb-prints of Italians with that
peculiar incurvature of the ball of the thumb
that denotes a Sicilian brigand?"</p>

<p>"There were three of those," said Inspector
Edwards gloomily. "No, Mr. Kent, the thumb
stuff is no good."</p>

<p>Kent thought again.</p>

<p>"Inspector," he said, "what about mysterious
women? Have you seen any around?"</p>

<p>"Four went by this morning," said the
Inspector, "one at eleven-thirty, one at twelve-thirty,
and two together at one-thirty. At
least," he added sadly, "I think they were
mysterious. All women look mysterious
to me."</p>

<p>"I must try in another direction," said Kent.
"Let me reconstruct the whole thing. I must
weave a chain of analysis. Kivas Kelly was
a bachelor, was he not?"</p>

<p>"He was. He lived alone here."</p>

<p>"Very good, I suppose he had in his
employ a butler who had been with him for
twenty years&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Edwards nodded.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose you've arrested him?"</p>

<p>"At once," said the Inspector. "We always
arrest the butler, Mr. Kent. They expect it.
In fact, this man, Williams, gave himself up
at once."</p>

<p>"And let me see," continued the Investigator.
"I presume there was a housekeeper
who lived on the top floor, and who had been
stone deaf for ten years?"</p>

<p>"Precisely."</p>

<p>"She had heard nothing during the murder?"</p>

<p>"Not a thing. But this may have been on
account of her deafness."</p>

<p>"True, true," murmured Kent. "And I
suppose there was a coachman, a thoroughly
reliable man, who lived with his wife at the
back of the house&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But who had taken his wife over to see
a relation on the night of the murder, and
who did not return until an advanced hour.
Mr. Kent, we've been all over that. There's
nothing in it."</p>

<p>"Were there any other persons belonging
to the establishment?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>"There was Mr. Kelly's stenographer, Alice
Delary, but she only came in the mornings."</p>

<p>"Have you seen her?" asked Kent eagerly.
"What is she like?"</p>

<p>"I have seen her," said the Inspector.
"She's a looloo."</p>

<p>"Ha," said Kent, "a looloo!" The two
men looked into one another's eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes," repeated Edwards thoughtfully, "a
peach."</p>

<p>A sudden swift flash of intuition, an inspiration,
leapt into the young reporter's brain.</p>

<p>This girl, this peach, at all hazards he must
save her life.<br />
<br />
</p>

<h4>I MUST BUY A BOOK ON BILLIARDS</h4>


<p>Kent turned to the Inspector. "Take me
into the house," he said. Edwards led the
way. The interior of the handsome mansion
seemed undisturbed. "I see no sign of a
struggle here," said Kent.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," answered the Inspector gloomily.
"We can find no sign of a struggle anywhere.
But, then, we never do."</p>

<p>He opened for the moment the door of the
stately drawing-room. "No sign of a struggle
there," he said. The closed blinds, the draped
furniture, the covered piano, the muffled chandelier,
showed absolutely no sign of a
struggle.</p>

<p>"Come upstairs to the billiard-room," said
Edwards. "The body has been removed for
the inquest, but nothing else is disturbed."</p>

<p>They went upstairs. On the second floor
was the billiard-room, with a great English
table in the centre of it. But Kent had at
once dashed across to the window, an exclamation
on his lips. "Ha! ha!" he said,
"what have we here?"</p>

<p>The Inspector shook his head quietly. "The
window," he said in a monotonous, almost sing-song
tone, "has apparently been opened from
the outside, the sash being lifted with some
kind of a sharp instrument. The dust on
the sill outside has been disturbed as if by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
a man of extraordinary agility lying on his
stomach&mdash;&mdash;Don't bother about that, Mr.
Kent. It's <i>always</i> there."</p>

<p>"True," said Kent. Then he cast his eyes
upward, and again an involuntary exclamation
broke from him. "Did you see that trap-door?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"We did," said Edwards. "The dust around
the rim has been disturbed. The trap opens
into the hollow of the roof. A man of extraordinary
dexterity might open the trap with
a billiard cue, throw up a fine manila rope,
climb up the rope and lie there on his
stomach.</p>

<p>"No use," continued the Inspector. "For
the matter of that, look at this huge old-fashioned
fireplace. A man of extraordinary
precocity could climb up the chimney. Or
this dumb-waiter on a pulley, for serving
drinks, leading down into the maids' quarters.
A man of extreme indelicacy might ride up
and down in it."</p>

<p>"Stop a minute," said Kent. "What is the
meaning of that hat?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>A light gossamer hat, gay with flowers, hung
on a peg at the side of the room.</p>

<p>"We thought of that," said Edwards, "and
we have left it there. Whoever comes for
that hat has had a hand in the mystery. We
think&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Transome Kent was no longer listening.
He had seized the edge of the billiard table.</p>

<p>"Look, look!" he cried eagerly. "The clue
to the mystery! The positions of the billiard
balls! The white ball in the very centre of
the table, and the red just standing on the
verge of the end pocket! What does it mean,
Edwards, what does it mean?"</p>

<p>He had grasped Edwards by the arm and
was peering into his face.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said the Inspector. "I
don't play billiards."</p>

<p>"Neither do I," said Kent, "but I can find
out. Quick! The nearest book-store. I must
buy a book on billiards."</p>

<p>With a wave of the arm, Kent vanished.</p>

<p>The Inspector stood for a moment in thought.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>"Gone!" he murmured to himself (it was
his habit to murmur all really important
speeches aloud to himself). "Now, why did
Throgton telephone to me to put a watch on
Kent? Ten dollars a day to shadow him! Why?"
<br />
<br />
</p>

<h4>THAT IS NOT BILLIARD CHALK</h4>

<p>Meantime at the <i>Planet</i> office Masterman
Throgton was putting on his coat to go home.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir," said an employ&eacute;, "there's
a lot of green billiard chalk on your sleeve."</p>

<p>Throgton turned and looked the man full
in the eye.</p>

<p>"That is not billiard chalk," he said, "it is
face powder."</p>

<p>Saying which this big, imperturbable, self-contained
man stepped into the elevator and
went to the ground floor in one drop<br />

<h3><a name="IV_V" id="IV_V"></a>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<h4>HAS ANYBODY HERE SEEN KELLY?</h4>

<p>The inquest upon the body of Kivas Kelly
was held upon the following day. Far from
offering any solution of what had now become
an unfathomable mystery, it only made it
deeper still. The medical testimony, though
given by the most distinguished consulting expert
of the city, was entirely inconclusive. The
body, the expert testified, showed evident
marks of violence. There was a distinct lesion
of the &oelig;sophagus and a decided excoriation
of the fibula. The mesodenum was gibbous.
There was a certain quantity of flab in the
binomium and the proscenium was wide open.</p>

<p>One striking fact, however, was decided
from the testimony of the expert, namely, that
the stomach of the deceased was found to contain
half a pint of arsenic. On this point
the questioning of the district attorney was
close and technical. Was it unusual, he asked,
to find arsenic in the stomach? In the stomach<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
of a club man, no. Was not half a pint a
large quantity? He would not say that. Was
it a small quantity? He should not care to
say that it was. Would half a pint of arsenic
cause death? Of a club man, no, not
necessarily. That was all.</p>

<p>The other testimony submitted to the
inquest jury brought out various facts of a
substantive character, but calculated rather to
complicate than to unravel the mystery. The
butler swore that on the very day of the
murder he had served his master a half-pint
of arsenic at lunch. But he claimed that this
was quite a usual happening with his master.
On cross-examination it appeared that he meant
apollinaris. He was certain, however, that it
was half a pint. The butler, it was shown,
had been in Kivas Kelly's employ for twenty
years.</p>

<p>The coachman, an Irishman, was closely
questioned. He had been in Mr. Kelly's employ
for three years&mdash;ever since his arrival
from the old country. Was it true that he had
had, on the day of the murder, a violent quarrel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
with his master? It was. Had he threatened
to kill him? No. He had threatened to knock
his block off, but not to kill him.</p>

<p>The coroner looked at his notes. "Call
Alice Delary," he commanded. There was
a deep sensation in the court as Miss Delary
quietly stepped forward to her place in the
witness-box.</p>

<p>Tall, graceful and willowy, Alice Delary was
in her first burst of womanhood. Those who
looked at the beautiful girl realized that if her
first burst was like this, what would the second,
or the third be like?</p>

<p>The girl was trembling, and evidently distressed,
but she gave her evidence in a clear,
sweet, low voice. She had been in Mr. Kelly's
employ three years. She was his stenographer.
But she came only in the mornings and always
left at lunch-time. The question immediately
asked by the jury&mdash;"Where did she generally
have lunch?"&mdash;was disallowed by the coroner.
Asked by a member of the jury what system of
shorthand she used, she answered, "Pitman's."
Asked by another juryman whether she ever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
cared to go to moving pictures, she said that
she went occasionally. This created a favourable
impression. "Miss Delary," said the
district attorney, "I want to ask if it is your
hat that was found hanging in the billiard-room
after the crime?"</p>

<p>"Don't you dare ask that girl that," interrupted
the magistrate. "Miss Delary, you may
step down."</p>

<p>But the principal sensation of the day arose
out of the evidence offered by Masterman
Throgton, general manager of the <i>Planet</i>.
Kivas Kelly, he testified, had dined with him
at his club on the fateful evening. He had
afterwards driven him to his home.</p>

<p>"When you went into the house with the
deceased," asked the district attorney, "how
long did you remain there with him?"</p>

<p>"That," said Throgton quietly, "I must
refuse to answer."</p>

<p>"Would it incriminate you?" asked the
coroner, leaning forward.</p>

<p>"It might," said Throgton.</p>

<p>"Then you're perfectly right not to answer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
it," said the coroner. "Don't ask him that
any more. Ask something else."</p>

<p>"Then did you," questioned the attorney,
turning to Throgton again, "play a game of
billiards with the deceased?"</p>

<p>"Stop, stop," said the coroner, "that
question I can't allow. It's too direct, too
brutal; there's something about that question,
something mean, dirty. Ask another."</p>

<p>"Very good," said the attorney. "Then
tell me, Mr. Throgton, if you ever saw this
blue envelope before?" He held up in his
hand a long blue envelope.</p>

<p>"Never in my life," said Throgton.</p>

<p>"Of course he didn't," said the coroner.
"Let's have a look at it. What is it?"</p>

<p>"This envelope, your Honour, was found
sticking out of the waistcoat pocket of the
deceased."</p>

<p>"You don't say," said the coroner. "And
what's in it?"</p>

<p>Amid breathless silence, the attorney drew
forth a sheet of blue paper, bearing a stamp,
and read:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>"This is the last will and testament of me,
Kivas Kelly of New York. I leave everything
of which I die possessed to my nephew, Peter
Kelly."</p>

<p>The entire room gasped. No one spoke.
The coroner looked all around. "Has anybody
here seen Kelly?" he asked.</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>The coroner repeated the question.</p>

<p>No one moved.</p>

<p>"Mr. Coroner," said the attorney, "it is
my opinion that if Peter Kelly is found the
mystery is fathomed."</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the jury returned a verdict
of murder against a person or persons unknown,
adding that they would bet a dollar that Kelly
did it.</p>

<p>The coroner ordered the butler to be
released, and directed the issue of a warrant
for the arrest of Peter Kelly.<br />

<h3><a name="IV_VI" id="IV_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h3>

<h4>SHOW ME THE MAN WHO WORE THOSE BOOTS</h4>

<p>The remains of the unhappy club man were
buried on the following day as reverently as
those of a club man can be. None followed
him to the grave except a few morbid curiosity-seekers,
who rode on top of the hearse.</p>

<p>The great city turned again to its usual
avocations. The unfathomable mystery was
dismissed from the public mind.</p>

<p>Meantime Transome Kent was on the trail.
Sleepless, almost foodless, and absolutely drinkless,
he was everywhere. He was looking for
Peter Kelly. Wherever crowds were gathered,
the Investigator was there, searching for Kelly.
In the great concourse of the Grand Central
Station, Kent moved to and fro, peering into
everybody's face. An official touched him on
the shoulder. "Stop peering into the people's
faces," he said. "I am unravelling a mystery,"
Kent answered. "I beg your pardon, sir,"
said the man, "I didn't know."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>Kent was here, and everywhere, moving
ceaselessly, pro and con, watching for Kelly.
For hours he stood beside the soda-water
fountains examining every drinker as he drank.
For three days he sat on the steps of Masterman
Throgton's home, disguised as a plumber
waiting for a wrench.</p>

<p>But still no trace of Peter Kelly. Young
Kelly, it appeared, had lived with his uncle
until a little less than three years ago. Then
suddenly he had disappeared. He had vanished,
as a brilliant writer for the New York Press
framed it, as if the earth had swallowed
him up.</p>

<p>Transome Kent, however, was not a man to
be baffled by initial defeat.</p>

<p>A week later, the Investigator called in at
the office of Inspector Edwards.</p>

<p>"Inspector," he said, "I must have some
more clues. Take me again to the Kelly
residence. I must re-analyse my first di&aelig;resis."</p>

<p>Together the two friends went to the house.
"It is inevitable," said Kent, as they entered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
again the fateful billiard-room, "that we have
overlooked something."</p>

<p>"We always do," said Edwards gloomily.</p>

<p>"Now tell me," said Kent, as they stood beside
the billiard table, "what is your own theory,
the police theory, of this murder? Give me
your first theory first, and then go on with
the others."</p>

<p>"Our first theory, Mr. Kent, was that the
murder was committed by a sailor with a
wooden leg, newly landed from Java."</p>

<p>"Quite so, quite proper," nodded Kent.</p>

<p>"We knew that he was a sailor," the Inspector
went on, dropping again into his sing-song
monotone, "by the extraordinary agility
needed to climb up the thirty feet of bare brick
wall to the window&mdash;a landsman could not have
climbed more than twenty; the fact that he
was from the East Indies we knew from the
peculiar knot about his victim's neck. We
knew that he had a wooden leg&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Inspector paused and looked troubled.</p>

<p>"We knew it." He paused again. "I'm
afraid I can't remember that one."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tut, tut," said Kent gently, "you knew it,
Edwards, because when he leaned against the
billiard table the impress of his hand on
the mahogany was deeper on one side than
the other. The man was obviously top heavy.
But you abandoned this first theory."</p>

<p>"Certainly, Mr. Kent, we always do. Our
second theory was&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Kent had ceased to listen. He had
suddenly stooped down and picked up something
off the floor.</p>

<p>"Ha ha!" he exclaimed. "What do you
make of this?" He held up a square fragment
of black cloth.</p>

<p>"We never saw it," said Edwards.</p>

<p>"Cloth," muttered Kent, "the missing piece
of Kivas Kelly's dinner jacket." He whipped
out a magnifying glass. "Look," he said, "it's
been stamped upon&mdash;by a man wearing hob-nailed
boots&mdash;made in Ireland&mdash;a man of five
feet nine and a half inches high&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One minute, Mr. Kent," interrupted the
Inspector, greatly excited, "I don't quite get it."</p>

<p>"The depth of the dint proves the lift of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
his foot," said Kent impatiently, "and the lift
of the foot indicates at once the man's height.
Edwards, find me the man who wore these
boots and the mystery is solved!"</p>

<p>At that very moment a heavy step, unmistakably
to the trained ear that of a man in
hob-nailed boots, was heard upon the stair.
The door opened and a man stood hesitating
in the doorway.</p>

<p>Both Kent and Edwards gave a start, two
starts, of surprise.</p>

<p>The man was exactly five feet nine and a half
inches high. He was dressed in coachman's
dress. His face was saturnine and evil.</p>

<p>It was Dennis, the coachman of the murdered
man.</p>

<p>"If you're Mr. Kent," he said, "there's a
lady here asking for you."
<br />
<br />
</p>
<h3><a name="IV_VII" id="IV_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h3>

<h4>OH, MR. KENT, SAVE ME!</h4>

<p>In another moment an absolutely noiseless
step was heard upon the stair.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>A young girl entered, a girl, tall, willowy
and beautiful, in the first burst, or just about
the first burst, of womanhood.</p>

<p>It was Alice Delary.</p>

<p>She was dressed with extreme taste, but
Kent's quick eye noted at once that she wore
no hat.</p>

<p>"Mr. Kent," she cried, "you are Mr. Kent,
are you not? They told me that you were
here. Oh, Mr. Kent, help me, save me!"</p>

<p>She seemed to shudder into herself a
moment. Her breath came and went quickly.</p>

<p>She reached out her two hands.</p>

<p>"Calm yourself, my dear young lady," said
Kent, taking them. "Don't let your breath
come and go so much. Trust me. Tell
me all."</p>

<p>"Mr. Kent," said Delary, regaining her control,
but still trembling, "I want my hat."</p>

<p>Kent let go the beautiful girl's hands. "Sit
down," he said. Then he went across the
room and fetched the hat, the light gossamer
hat, with flowers in it, that still hung on a peg.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am so glad to get it back," cried the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
girl. "I can never thank you enough. I was
afraid to come for it."</p>

<p>"It is all right," said the Inspector. "The
police theory was that it was the housekeeper's
hat. You are welcome to it."</p>

<p>Kent had been looking closely at the girl
before him.</p>

<p>"You have more to say than that," he said.
"Tell me all."</p>

<p>"Oh, I will, I will, Mr. Kent. That dreadful
night! I was here. I saw, at least I heard
it all."</p>

<p>She shuddered.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Kent, it was dreadful! I had
come back that evening to the library to finish
some work. I knew that Mr. Kelly was to
dine out and that I would be alone. I had
been working quietly for some time when I
became aware of voices in the billiard-room.
I tried not to listen, but they seemed to be
quarrelling, and I couldn't help hearing. Oh,
Mr. Kent, was I wrong?"</p>

<p>"No," said Kent, taking her hand a moment,
"you were not."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>"I heard one say, 'Get your foot off the
table, you've no right to put your foot on the
table.' Then the other said, 'Well, you keep
your stomach off the cushion then.'" The
girl shivered. "Then presently one said, quite
fiercely, 'Get back into balk there, get back
fifteen inches,' and the other voice said, 'By
God! I'll shoot from here.' Then there was a
dead stillness, and then a voice almost screamed,
'You've potted me. You've potted me. That
ends it.' And then I heard the other say in a
low tone, 'Forgive me, I didn't mean it. I
never meant it to end that way.'</p>

<p>"I was so frightened, Mr. Kent, I couldn't
stay any longer. I rushed downstairs and ran
all the way home. Then next day I read what
had happened, and I knew that I had left my
hat there, and was afraid. Oh, Mr. Kent,
save me!"</p>

<p>"Miss Delary," said the Investigator, taking
again the girl's hands and looking into her
eyes, "you are safe. Tell me only one thing.
The man who played against Kivas Kelly&mdash;did
you see him?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>"Only for one moment"&mdash;the girl paused&mdash;"through
the keyhole."</p>

<p>"What was he like?" asked Kent. "Had he
an impenetrable face?"</p>

<p>"He had."</p>

<p>"Was there anything massive about his
face?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, yes, it was all massive."</p>

<p>"Miss Delary," said Kent, "this mystery is
now on the brink of solution. When I have
joined the last links of the chain, may I come
and tell you all?"</p>

<p>She looked full in his face.</p>

<p>"At any hour of the day or night," she said,
"you may come."</p>

<p>Then she was gone.
<br />
<br />
</p>

<h3><a name="IV_VIII" id="IV_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h3>
<h4>YOU ARE PETER KELLY</h4>

<p>Within a few moments Kent was at the
phone.</p>

<p>"I want four, four, four, four. Is that four,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
four, four, four? Mr. Throgton's house? I
want Mr. Throgton. Mr. Throgton speaking?
Mr. Throgton, Kent speaking. The Riverside
mystery is solved."</p>

<p>Kent waited in silence a moment. Then
he heard Throgton's voice&mdash;not a note in it
disturbed:</p>

<p>"Has anybody found Kelly?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Throgton," said Kent, and he spoke
with a strange meaning in his tone, "the story
is a long one. Suppose I relate it to you"&mdash;he
paused, and laid a peculiar emphasis on what
followed&mdash;"<i>over a game of billiards</i>."</p>

<p>"What the devil do you mean?" answered
Throgton.</p>

<p>"Let me come round to your house and tell
the story. There are points in it that I can
best illustrate over a billiard table. Suppose
I challenge you to a fifty point game before I
tell my story."</p>

<p class="tb">* * * * *</p>

<p>It required no little hardihood to challenge
Masterman Throgton at billiards. His reputation
at his club as a cool, determined player<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
was surpassed by few. Throgton had been
known to run nine, ten, and even twelve at a
break. It was not unusual for him to drive
his ball clear off the table. His keen eye told
him infallibly where each of the three balls
was; instinctively he knew which to shoot with.</p>

<p>In Kent, however, he had no mean adversary.
The young reporter, though he had never
played before, had studied his book to some
purpose. His strategy was admirable. Keeping
his ball well under the shelter of the cushion,
he eluded every stroke of his adversary, and in
his turn caused his ball to leap or dart across
the table with such speed as to bury itself in
the pocket at the side.</p>

<p>The score advanced rapidly, both players
standing precisely equal. At the end of the
first half-hour it stood at ten all. Throgton, a
grim look upon his face, had settled down to
work, playing with one knee on the table.
Kent, calm but alive with excitement, leaned
well forward to his stroke, his eye held within
an inch of the ball.</p>

<p>At fifteen they were still even. Throgton<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
with a sudden effort forced a break of three;
but Kent rallied and in another twenty minutes
they were even again at nineteen all.</p>

<p>But it was soon clear that Transome Kent
had something else in mind than to win the
game. Presently his opportunity came. With
a masterly stroke, such as few trained players
could use, he had potted his adversary's ball.
The red ball was left over the very jaws of
the pocket. The white was in the centre.</p>

<p>Kent looked into Throgton's face.</p>

<p>The balls were standing in the very same
position on the table as on the night of the
murder.</p>

<p>"I did that on purpose," said Kent quietly.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Throgton.</p>

<p>"The position of those balls," said Kent.
"Mr. Throgton, come into the library. I have
something to say to you. You know already
what it is."</p>

<p>They went into the library. Throgton, his
hand unsteady, lighted a cigar.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "what is it?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Throgton," said Kent, "two weeks ago<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
you gave me a mystery to solve. To-night I
can give you the solution. Do you want it?"</p>

<p>Throgton's face never moved.</p>

<p>"Well," he said.</p>

<p>"A man's life," Kent went on, "may be
played out on a billiard table. A man's soul,
Throgton, may be pocketed."</p>

<p>"What devil's foolery is this?" said Throgton.
"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean that your crime is known&mdash;plotter,
schemer that you are, you are found out&mdash;hypocrite,
traitor; yes, Masterman Throgton,
or rather&mdash;let me give you your true name-<i>Peter
Kelly</i>, murderer, I denounce you!"</p>

<p>Throgton never flinched. He walked across
to where Kent stood, and with his open palm
he slapped him over the mouth.</p>

<p>"Transome Kent," he said, "you're a liar."</p>

<p>Then he walked back to his chair and sat
down.</p>

<p>"Kent," he continued, "from the first moment
of your mock investigation, I knew who
you were. Your every step was shadowed,
your every movement dogged. Transome<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
Kent&mdash;by your true name, <i>Peter Kelly</i>, murderer,
I denounce you."</p>

<p>Kent walked quietly across to Throgton and
dealt him a fearful blow behind the ear.</p>

<p>"You're a liar," he said, "I am not Peter
Kelly."</p>

<p>They sat looking at one another.</p>

<p>At that moment Throgton's servant appeared
at the door.</p>

<p>"A gentleman to see you, sir."</p>

<p>"Who?" said Throgton.</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir, he gave his card."</p>

<p>Masterman Throgton took the card.</p>

<p>On it was printed:</p>

<p class="center"><i>PETER KELLY</i>
<br />

<h3><a name="IV_IX" id="IV_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h3>

<h4>LET ME TELL YOU THE STORY OF MY LIFE</h4>


<p>For a moment Throgton and Kent sat
looking at one another.</p>

<p>"Show the man up," said Throgton.</p>

<p>A minute later the door opened and a man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
entered. Kent's keen eye analysed him as
he stood. His blue clothes, his tanned face,
and the extraordinary dexterity of his fingers
left no doubt of his calling. He was a
sailor.</p>

<p>"Sit down," said Throgton.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said the sailor, "it rests my
wooden leg."</p>

<p>The two men looked again. One of the
sailor's legs was made of wood. With a start
Kent noticed that it was made of East Indian
sandalwood.</p>

<p>"I've just come from Java," said Kelly
quietly, as he sat down.</p>

<p>Kent nodded. "I see it all now," he said.
"Throgton, I wronged you. We should have
known it was a sailor with a wooden leg from
Java. There is no other way."</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said Peter Kelly, "I've come
to make my confession. It is the usual and
right thing to do, gentlemen, and I want to go
through with it while I can."</p>

<p>"One moment," said Kent, "do you mind
interrupting yourself with a hacking cough?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," said Kelly, "I'll get to
that a little later. Let me begin by telling you
the story of my life."</p>

<p>"No, no," urged Throgton and Kent, "don't
do that!"</p>

<p>Kelly frowned. "I think I have a right to,"
he said. "You've got to hear it. As a boy I
had a wild, impulsive nature. Had it been
curbed&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But it wasn't," said Throgton. "What
next?"</p>

<p>"I was the sole relative of my uncle, and
heir to great wealth. Pampered with every
luxury, I was on a footing of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One minute," interrupted Kent, rapidly
analysing as he listened. "How many legs had
you then?"</p>

<p>"Two&mdash;on a footing of ease and indolence.
I soon lost&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your leg," said Throgton. "Mr. Kelly,
pray come to the essential things."</p>

<p>"I will," said the sailor. "Gentlemen, bad
as I was, I was not altogether bad."</p>

<p>"Of course not," said Kent and Throgton<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
soothingly. "Probably not more than ninety
per cent."</p>

<p>"Even into my life, gentlemen, love entered.
If you had seen her you would have known that
she is as innocent as the driven snow. Three
years ago she came to my uncle's house. I
loved her. One day, hardly knowing what I
was doing, I took her&mdash;&mdash;" he paused.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said Throgton and Kent, "you
took her?"</p>

<p>"To the Aquarium. My uncle heard of it.
There was a violent quarrel. He disinherited
me and drove me from the house. I had a
liking for the sea from a boy."</p>

<p>"Excuse me," said Kent, "from what boy?"</p>

<p>Kelly went right on. "I ran away as a sailor
before the mast."</p>

<p>"Pardon me," interrupted Kent, "I am not
used to sea terms. Why didn't you run <i>behind</i>
the mast?"</p>

<p>"Hear me out," said Kelly, "I am nearly
done. We sailed for the East Indies&mdash;for
Java. There a Malay pirate bit off my leg.
I returned home, bitter, disillusioned, the mere<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
wreck that you see. I had but one thought. I
meant to kill my uncle."</p>

<p>For a moment a hacking cough interrupted
Kelly. Kent and Throgton nodded quietly to
one another.</p>

<p>"I came to his house at night. With the
aid of my wooden leg I scaled the wall, lifted
the window and entered the billiard-room.
There was murder in my heart. Thank God
I was spared from that. At the very moment
when I got in, a light was turned on in the
room and I saw before me&mdash;but no, I will
not name her&mdash;my better angel. 'Peter!' she
cried, then with a woman's intuition she exclaimed,
'You have come to murder your uncle.
Don't do it.' My whole mood changed. I
broke down and cried like a&mdash;like a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Kelly paused a moment.</p>

<p>"Like a boob," said Kent softly. "Go
on."</p>

<p>"When I had done crying, we heard voices.
'Quick,' she exclaimed, 'flee, hide, he must not
see you.' She rushed into the adjoining room,
closing the door. My eye had noticed already<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
the trap above. I climbed up to it. Shall I
explain how?"</p>

<p>"Don't," said Kent, "I can analyse it
afterwards."</p>

<p>"There I saw what passed. I saw Mr.
Throgton and Kivas Kelly come in. I watched
their game. They were greatly excited and
quarrelled over it. Throgton lost."</p>

<p>The big man nodded with a scowl. "By his
potting the white," he said.</p>

<p>"Precisely," said Kelly, "he missed the red.
Your analysis was wrong, Mr. Kent. The game
ended. You started your reasoning from a false
di&aelig;resis. In billiards people never mark the
last point. The board still showed ninety-nine
all. Throgton left and my uncle, as
often happens, kept trying over the last shot&mdash;a
half-ball shot, sir, with the red over the
pocket. He tried again and again. He
couldn't make it. He tried various ways. His
rest was too unsteady. Finally he made his tie
into a long loop round his neck and put his cue
through it. 'Now, by gad!' he said, 'I can
do it.'"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ha!" said Kent. "Fool that I was."</p>

<p>"Exactly," continued Kelly. "In the excitement
of watching my uncle I forgot where
I was, I leaned too far over and fell out of the
trap. I landed on uncle, just as he was sitting
on the table to shoot. He fell."</p>

<p>"I see it all!" said Kent. "He hit his
head, the loop tightened, the cue spun round
and he was dead."</p>

<p>"That's it," said Kelly. "I saw that he
was dead, and I did not dare to remain. I
straightened the knot in his tie, laid his hands
reverently across his chest, and departed as I
had come."</p>

<p>"Mr. Kelly," said Throgton thoughtfully,
"the logic of your story is wonderful. It
exceeds anything in its line that I have seen published
for months. But there is just one point
that I fail to grasp. The two bullet holes?"</p>

<p>"They were old ones," answered the sailor
quietly. "My uncle in his youth had led a
wild life in the west; he was full of them."</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment. Then Kelly
spoke again:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>"My time, gentlemen, is short." (A hacking
cough interrupted him.) "I feel that I am
withering. It rests with you, gentlemen,
whether or not I walk out of this room a free
man."</p>

<p>Transome Kent rose and walked over to the
sailor.</p>

<p>"Mr. Kelly," he said, "here is my hand."
<br />
<br />
</p>

<h3><a name="IV_X" id="IV_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h3>

<h4>SO DO I</h4>

<p>A few days after the events last narrated,
Transome Kent called at the boarding-house of
Miss Alice Delary. The young Investigator
wore a light grey tweed suit, with a salmon-coloured
geranium in his buttonhole. There
was something exultant yet at the same time
grave in his expression, as of one who has
taken a momentous decision, affecting his
future life.</p>

<p>"I wonder," he murmured, "whether I am
acting for my happiness."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>He sat down for a moment on the stone
steps and analysed himself.</p>

<p>Then he rose.</p>

<p>"I am," he said, and rang the bell.</p>

<p>"Miss Delary?" said a maid, "she left here
two days ago. If you are Mr. Kent, the note
on the mantelpiece is for you."</p>

<p>Without a word (Kent never wasted them)
the Investigator opened the note and read:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Kent</span>,<br />

"Peter and I were married yesterday
morning, and have taken an apartment in Java,
New Jersey. You will be glad to hear that
Peter's cough is ever so much better. The
lawyers have given Peter his money without the
least demur.</p>

<p>"We both feel that your analysis was simply
wonderful. Peter says he doesn't know where
he would be without it.</p>

<p>"Very sincerely,</p>

<p style="text-align:right">"<span class="smcap">Alice Kelly</span>.</p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;I forgot to mention to you that I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
saw Peter in the billiard-room. But your
analysis was marvellous just the same."</p></div>

<p class="tb">* * * * *</p>

<p>That evening Kent sat with Throgton talking
over the details of the tragedy.</p>

<p>"Throgton," he said, "it has occurred to me
that there were points about that solution that
we didn't get exactly straight somehow."</p>

<p>"So do I," said Throgton.

<h3><i>BROKEN BARRIERS</i></h3>

<h4><i>OR, RED LOVE ON A BLUE ISLAND</i></h4>

<p class="center">(<i>The kind of thing that has replaced the good Old Sea Story</i>)</p>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>It was on a bright August afternoon that
I stepped on board the steamer <i>Patagonia</i>
at Southampton outward bound for the
West Indies and the Port of New
Orleans.</p>

<p>I had at the time no presentiment of disaster.
I remember remarking to the ship's purser, as
my things were being carried to my state-room,
that I had never in all my travels entered upon
any voyage with so little premonition of accident.
"Very good, Mr. Borus," he answered.
"You will find your state-room in the starboard
aisle on the right." I distinctly recall remarking
to the Captain that I had never, in any of
my numerous seafarings, seen the sea of a more
limpid blue. He agreed with me so entirely,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
as I recollect it, that he did not even trouble
to answer.</p>

<p>Had anyone told me on that bright summer
afternoon that our ship would within a week
be wrecked among the Dry Tortugas, I should
have laughed. Had anyone informed me that I
should find myself alone on a raft in the Caribbean
Sea, I should have gone into hysterics.</p>

<p>We had hardly entered the waters of the
Caribbean when a storm of unprecedented violence
broke upon us. Even the Captain had
never, so he said, seen anything to compare
with it. For two days and nights we encountered
and endured the full fury of the sea.
Our soup plates were secured with racks and
covered with lids. In the smoking-room our
glasses had to be set in brackets, and as our
steward came and went, we were from moment
to moment in imminent danger of seeing him
washed overboard.</p>

<p>On the third morning just after daybreak the
ship collided with something, probably either
a floating rock or one of the dry Tortugas.
She blew out her four funnels, the bowsprit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
dropped out of its place, and the propeller
came right off. The Captain, after a brief
consultation, decided to abandon her. The
boats were lowered, and, the sea being now quite
calm, the passengers were emptied into them.</p>

<p>By what accident I was left behind I cannot
tell. I had been talking to the second mate
and telling him of a rather similar experience
of mine in the China Sea, and holding him by
the coat as I did so, when quite suddenly he
took me by the shoulders, and rushing me into
the deserted smoking-room said, "Sit there,
Mr. Borus, till I come back for you." The
fellow spoke in such a menacing way that I
thought it wiser to comply.</p>

<p>When I came out they were all gone. By
good fortune I found one of the ship's rafts
still lying on the deck. I gathered together
such articles as might be of use and contrived,
though how I do not know, to launch it into
the sea.</p>

<p>On my second morning on my raft I was
sitting quietly polishing my boots and talking
to myself when I became aware of an object<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
floating in the sea close beside the raft. Judge
of my feelings when I realized it to be the
inanimate body of a girl. Hastily finishing
my boots and stopping talking to myself, I
made shift as best I could to draw the unhappy
girl towards me with a hook.</p>

<p>After several ineffectual attempts I at last
managed to obtain a hold of the girl's clothing
and drew her on to the raft.</p>

<p>She was still unconscious. The heavy lifebelt
round her person must (so I divined) have
kept her afloat after the wreck. Her clothes
were sodden, so I reasoned, with the sea-water.</p>

<p>On a handkerchief which was still sticking
into the belt of her dress, I could see letters
embroidered. Realizing that this was no time
for hesitation, and that the girl's life might
depend on my reading her name, I plucked
it forth. It was Edith Croyden.</p>

<p>As vigorously as I could I now set to work
to rub her hands. My idea was (partly) to restore
her circulation. I next removed her boots,
which were now rendered useless, as I argued,
by the sea-water, and began to rub her feet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>I was just considering what to remove next,
when the girl opened her eyes. "Stop rubbing
my feet," she said.</p>

<p>"Miss Croyden," I said, "you mistake
me."</p>

<p>I rose, with a sense of pique which I did not
trouble to conceal, and walked to the other end
of the raft. I turned my back upon the girl
and stood looking out upon the leaden waters
of the Caribbean Sea. The ocean was now
calm. There was nothing in sight.</p>

<p>I was still searching the horizon when I
heard a soft footstep on the raft behind me,
and a light hand was laid upon my shoulder.
"Forgive me," said the girl's voice.</p>

<p>I turned about. Miss Croyden was standing
behind me. She had, so I argued, removed
her stockings and was standing in her bare feet.
There is something, I am free to confess, about
a woman in her bare feet which hits me where
I live. With instinctive feminine taste the girl
had twined a piece of seaweed in her hair.
Seaweed, as a rule, gets me every time. But
I checked myself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>"Miss Croyden," I said, "there is nothing
to forgive."</p>

<p>At the mention of her name the girl blushed
for a moment and seemed about to say something,
but stopped.</p>

<p>"Where are we?" she queried presently.</p>

<p>"I don't know," I answered, as cheerily as
I could, "but I am going to find out."</p>

<p>"How brave you are!" Miss Croyden
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Not at all," I said, putting as much heartiness
into my voice as I was able to.</p>

<p>The girl watched my preparations with
interest.</p>

<p>With the aid of a bent pin hoisted on a long
pole I had no difficulty in ascertaining our
latitude.</p>

<p>"Miss Croydon," I said, "I am now about
to ascertain our longitude. To do this I must
lower myself down into the sea. Pray do
not be alarmed or anxious. I shall soon be
back."</p>

<p>With the help of a long line I lowered
myself deep down into the sea until I was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
enabled to ascertain, approximately at any
rate, our longitude. A fierce thrill went through
me at the thought that this longitude was our
longitude, hers and mine. On the way up,
hand over hand, I observed a long shark looking
at me. Realizing that the fellow if
voracious might prove dangerous, I lost but
little time&mdash;indeed, I may say I lost absolutely
no time&mdash;in coming up the rope.</p>

<p>The girl was waiting for me.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am so glad you have come back," she
exclaimed, clasping her hands.</p>

<p>"It was nothing," I said, wiping the water
from my ears, and speaking as melodiously as
I could.</p>

<p>"Have you found our whereabouts?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered. "Our latitude is normal,
but our longitude is, I fear, at least three
degrees out of the plumb. I am afraid, Miss
Croyden," I added, speaking as mournfully as
I knew how, "that you must reconcile your
mind to spending a few days with me on this
raft."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is it as bad as that?" she murmured, her
eyes upon the sea.</p>

<p>In the long day that followed, I busied myself
as much as I could with my work upon the
raft, so as to leave the girl as far as possible
to herself. It was, so I argued, absolutely
necessary to let her feel that she was safe
in my keeping. Otherwise she might jump off
the raft and I should lose her.</p>

<p>I sorted out my various cans and tins, tested
the oil in my chronometer, arranged in neat
order my various ropes and apparatus, and got
my frying-pan into readiness for any emergency.
Of food we had for the present no lack.</p>

<p>With the approach of night I realized that it
was necessary to make arrangements for the
girl's comfort. With the aid of a couple of
upright poles I stretched a grey blanket across
the raft so as to make a complete partition.</p>

<p>"Miss Croyden," I said, "this end of the
raft is yours. Here you may sleep in
peace."</p>

<p>"How kind you are," the girl murmured.</p>

<p>"You will be quite safe from interference,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
I added. "I give you my word that I will not
obtrude upon you in any way."</p>

<p>"How chivalrous you are," she said.</p>

<p>"Not at all," I answered, as musically as I
could. "Understand me, I am now putting my
head over this partition for the last time. If
there is anything you want, say so now."</p>

<p>"Nothing," she answered.</p>

<p>"There is a candle and matches beside you.
If there is anything that you want in the night,
call me instantly. Remember, at any hour I
shall be here. I promise it."</p>

<p>"Good night," she murmured. In a few
minutes her soft regular breathing told me that
she was asleep.</p>

<p>I went forward and seated myself in a tar-bucket,
with my head against the mast, to get
what sleep I could.</p>

<p>But for some time&mdash;why, I do not know&mdash;sleep
would not come.</p>

<p>The image of Edith Croyden filled my mind.
In vain I told myself that she was a stranger
to me: that&mdash;beyond her longitude&mdash;I knew
nothing of her. In some strange way this girl<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
had seized hold of me and dominated my
senses.</p>

<p>The night was very calm and still, with great
stars in a velvet sky. In the darkness I could
hear the water lapping the edge of the raft.</p>

<p>I remained thus in deep thought, sinking
further and further into the tar-bucket. By
the time I reached the bottom of it I realized
that I was in love with Edith Croyden.</p>

<p>Then the thought of my wife occurred to me
and perplexed me. Our unhappy marriage had
taken place three years before. We brought to
one another youth, wealth and position. Yet
our marriage was a failure. My wife&mdash;for
what reason I cannot guess&mdash;seemed to find
my society irksome. In vain I tried to interest
her with narratives of my travels. They
seemed&mdash;in some way that I could not divine&mdash;to
fatigue her. "Leave me for a little,
Harold," she would say (I forgot to mention
that my name is Harold Borus), "I have a pain
in my neck." At her own suggestion I had
taken a trip around the world. On my return
she urged me to go round again. I was going<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
round for the third time when the wrecking of
the steamer had interrupted my trip.</p>

<p>On my own part, too, I am free to confess
that my wife's attitude had aroused in me a
sense of pique, not to say injustice. I am not
in any way a vain man. Yet her attitude
wounded me. I would no sooner begin,
"When I was in the Himalayas hunting the
humpo or humped buffalo," than she would
interrupt and say, "Oh, Harold, would you
mind going down to the billiard-room and
seeing if I left my cigarettes under the
billiard-table?" When I returned, she was
gone.</p>

<p>By agreement we had arranged for a divorce.
On my completion of my third voyage we were
to meet in New Orleans. Clara was to go
there on a separate ship, giving me the choice
of oceans.</p>

<p>Had I met Edith Croyden three months
later I should have been a man free to woo
and win her. As it was I was bound. I must
put a clasp of iron on my feelings. I must
wear a mask. Cheerful, helpful, and full of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
narrative, I must yet let fall no word of love
to this defenceless girl.</p>

<p>After a great struggle I rose at last from
the tar-bucket, feeling, if not a brighter, at
least a cleaner man.</p>

<p>Dawn was already breaking. I looked about
me. As the sudden beams of the tropic sun
illumined the placid sea, I saw immediately
before me, only a hundred yards away, an
island. A sandy beach sloped back to a rocky
eminence, broken with scrub and jungle. I
could see a little stream leaping among the
rocks. With eager haste I paddled the raft
close to the shore till it ground in about ten
inches of water.</p>

<p>I leaped into the water.</p>

<p>With the aid of a stout line, I soon made
the raft fast to a rock. Then as I turned I
saw that Miss Croyden was standing upon the
raft, fully dressed, and gazing at me. The
morning sunlight played in her hair, and her
deep blue eyes were as soft as the Caribbean
Sea itself.</p>

<p>"Don't attempt to wade ashore, Miss Croy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>den,"
I cried in agitation. "Pray do nothing
rash. The waters are simply infested with
bacilli."</p>

<p>"But how can I get ashore?" she asked,
with a smile which showed all, or nearly all, of
her pearl-like teeth.</p>

<p>"Miss Croyden," I said, "there is only one
way. I must carry you."</p>

<p>In another moment I had walked back to the
raft and lifted her as tenderly and reverently
as if she had been my sister&mdash;indeed more so&mdash;in
my arms.</p>

<p>Her weight seemed nothing. When I get
a girl like that in my arms I simply don't feel
it. Just for one moment as I clasped her thus
in my arms, a fierce thrill ran through me.
But I let it run.</p>

<p>When I had carried her well up the sand
close to the little stream, I set her down. To
my surprise, she sank down in a limp heap.</p>

<p>The girl had fainted.</p>

<p>I knew that it was no time for hesitation.</p>

<p>Running to the stream, I filled my hat with
water and dashed it in her face. Then I took<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
up a handful of mud and threw it at her with
all my force. After that I beat her with my
hat.</p>

<p>At length she opened her eyes and sat up.</p>

<p>"I must have fainted," she said, with a little
shiver. "I am cold. Oh, if we could only
have a fire."</p>

<p>"I will do my best to make one, Miss
Croyden," I replied, speaking as gymnastically
as I could. "I will see what I can do with
two dry sticks."</p>

<p>"With dry sticks?" queried the girl. "Can
you light a fire with that? How wonderful
you are!"</p>

<p>"I have often seen it done," I replied
thoughtfully; "when I was hunting the humpo,
or humped buffalo, in the Himalayas, it was
our usual method."</p>

<p>"Have you really hunted the humpo?" she
asked, her eyes large with interest.</p>

<p>"I have indeed," I said, "but you must
rest; later on I will tell you about it."</p>

<p>"I wish you could tell me now," she said
with a little moan.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>Meantime I had managed to select from
the driftwood on the beach two sticks that
seemed absolutely dry. Placing them carefully
together, in Indian fashion, I then struck a
match and found no difficulty in setting them
on fire.</p>

<p>In a few moments the girl was warming
herself beside a generous fire.</p>

<p>Together we breakfasted upon the beach
beside the fire, discussing our plans like
comrades.</p>

<p>Our meal over, I rose.</p>

<p>"I will leave you here a little," I said,
"while I explore."</p>

<p>With no great difficulty I made my way
through the scrub and climbed the eminence of
tumbled rocks that shut in the view.</p>

<p>On my return Miss Croyden was still seated
by the fire, her head in her hands.</p>

<p>"Miss Croyden," I said, "we are on an
island."</p>

<p>"Is it inhabited?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Once, perhaps, but not now. It is one of
the many keys of the West Indies. Here, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
old buccaneering days, the pirates landed and
careened their ships."</p>

<p>"How did they do that?" she asked,
fascinated.</p>

<p>"I am not sure," I answered. "I think with
white-wash. At any rate, they gave them a
good careening. But since then these solitudes
are only the home of the sea-gull, the sea-mew,
and the albatross."</p>

<p>The girl shuddered.</p>

<p>"How lonely!" she said.</p>

<p>"Lonely or not," I said with a laugh (luckily
I can speak with a laugh when I want to), "I
must get to work."</p>

<p>I set myself to work to haul up and arrange
our effects. With a few stones I made a rude
table and seats. I took care to laugh and sing
as much as possible while at my work. The
close of the day found me still busy with my
labours.</p>

<p>"Miss Croyden," I said, "I must now arrange
a place for you to sleep."</p>

<p>With the aid of four stakes driven deeply
into the ground and with blankets strung upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
them, I managed to fashion a sort of rude tent,
roofless, but otherwise quite sheltered.</p>

<p>"Miss Croyden," I said when all was done,
"go in there."</p>

<p>Then, with little straps which I had fastened
to the blankets, I buckled her in reverently.</p>

<p>"Good night, Miss Croyden," I said.</p>

<p>"But you," she exclaimed, "where will you
sleep?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I?" I answered, speaking as exuberantly
as I could, "I shall do very well on the
ground. But be sure to call me at the slightest
sound."</p>

<p>Then I went out and lay down in a patch of
cactus plants.</p>

<p class="tb">* * * * *</p>

<p>I need not dwell in detail upon the busy and
arduous days that followed our landing upon
the island. I had much to do. Each morning
I took our latitude and longitude. By this I
then set my watch, cooked porridge, and picked
flowers till Miss Croyden appeared.</p>

<p>With every day the girl came forth from
her habitation as a new surprise in her radiant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
beauty. One morning she had bound a cluster
of wild arbutus about her brow. Another day
she had twisted a band of convolvulus around
her waist. On a third she had wound herself
up in a mat of bulrushes.</p>

<p>With her bare feet and wild bulrushes all
around her, she looked as a cave woman might
have looked, her eyes radiant with the Caribbean
dawn. My whole frame thrilled at the
sight of her. At times it was all I could do
not to tear the bulrushes off her and beat
her with the heads of them. But I schooled
myself to restraint, and handed her a rock to
sit upon, and passed her her porridge on the end
of a shovel with the calm politeness of a friend.</p>

<p>Our breakfast over, my more serious labours
of the day began. I busied myself with hauling
rocks or boulders along the sand to build
us a house against the rainy season. With
some tackle from the raft I had made myself
a set of harness, by means of which I hitched
myself to a boulder. By getting Miss Croyden
to beat me over the back with a stick, I found
that I made fair progress.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>But even as I worked thus for our common
comfort, my mind was fiercely filled with the
thought of Edith Croyden. I knew that if once
the barriers broke everything would be swept
away. Heaven alone knows the effort that
it cost me. At times nothing but the sternest
resolution could hold my fierce impulses in
check. Once I came upon the girl writing in
the sand with a stick. I looked to see what
she had written. I read my own name "Harold."
With a wild cry I leapt into the sea
and dived to the bottom of it. When I came
up I was calmer. Edith came towards me;
all dripping as I was, she placed her hands
upon my shoulders. "How grand you are!"
she said. "I am," I answered; then I added,
"Miss Croyden, for Heaven's sake don't touch
me on the ear. I can't stand it." I turned
from her and looked out over the sea. Presently
I heard something like a groan behind
me. The girl had thrown herself on the sand
and was coiled up in a hoop. "Miss Croyden,"
I said, "for God's sake don't coil up in a
hoop."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>I rushed to the beach and rubbed gravel on
my face.</p>

<p>With such activities, alternated with wild
bursts of restraint, our life on the island passed
as rapidly as in a dream. Had I not taken
care to notch the days upon a stick and then
cover the stick with tar, I could not have known
the passage of the time. The wearing out of
our clothing had threatened a serious difficulty.
But by good fortune I had seen a large black
and white goat wandering among the rocks and
had chased it to a standstill. From its skin,
leaving the fur still on, Edith had fashioned
us clothes. Our boots we had replaced with
alligator hide. I had, by a lucky chance, found
an alligator upon the beach, and attaching a
string to the fellow's neck I had led him to our
camp. I had then poisoned the fellow with
tinned salmon and removed his hide.</p>

<p>Our costume was now brought into harmony
with our surroundings. For myself, garbed in
goatskin with the hair outside, with alligator
sandals on my feet and with whiskers at least
six inches long, I have no doubt that I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
resembled the beau ideal of a cave man. With
the open-air life a new agility seemed to have
come into my limbs. With a single leap in my
alligator sandals I was enabled to spring into
a coco-nut tree.</p>

<p>As for Edith Croyden, I can only say that
as she stood beside me on the beach in her
suit of black goatskin (she had chosen the
black spots) there were times when I felt like
seizing her in the frenzy of my passion and
hurling her into the sea. Fur always acts on
me just like that.</p>

<p>It was at the opening of the fifth week of
our life upon the island that a new and more
surprising turn was given to our adventure. It
arose out of a certain curiosity, harmless
enough, on Edith Croyden's part. "Mr.
Borus," she said one morning, "I should like
so much to see the rest of our island. Can
we?"</p>

<p>"Alas, Miss Croyden," I said, "I fear that
there is but little to see. Our island, so far as
I can judge, is merely one of the uninhabited
keys of the West Indies. It is nothing but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
rock and sand and scrub. There is no life upon
it. I fear," I added, speaking as jauntily as I
could, "that unless we are taken off it we are
destined to stay on it."</p>

<p>"Still I should like to see it," she persisted.</p>

<p>"Come on, then," I answered, "if you are
good for a climb we can take a look over the
ridge of rocks where I went up on the first
day."</p>

<p>We made our way across the sand of the
beach, among the rocks and through the close
matted scrub, beyond which an eminence of
rugged boulders shut out the further view.</p>

<p>Making our way to the top of this we
obtained a wide look over the sea. The island
stretched away to a considerable distance to
the eastward, widening as it went, the complete
view of it being shut off by similar and higher
ridges of rock.</p>

<p>But it was the nearer view, the foreground,
that at once arrested our attention. Edith
seized my arm. "Look, oh, look!" she
said.</p>

<p>Down just below us on the right hand was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
a similar beach to the one that we had left.
A rude hut had been erected on it and various
articles lay strewn about.</p>

<p>Seated on a rock with their backs towards us
were a man and a woman. The man was
dressed in goatskins, and his whiskers, so I
inferred from what I could see of them from
the side, were at least as exuberant as mine.
The woman was in white fur with a fillet of
seaweed round her head. They were sitting
close together as if in earnest colloquy.</p>

<p>"Cave people," whispered Edith, "aborigines
of the island."</p>

<p>But I answered nothing. Something in the
tall outline of the seated woman held my eye.
A cruel presentiment stabbed me to the heart.</p>

<p>In my agitation my foot overset a stone,
which rolled noisily down the rocks. The noise
attracted the attention of the two seated
below us. They turned and looked searchingly
towards the place where we were concealed.
Their faces were in plain sight. As I looked
at that of the woman I felt my heart cease
beating and the colour leave my face.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>I looked into Edith's face. It was as pale
as mine.</p>

<p>"What does it mean?" she whispered.</p>

<p>"Miss Croyden," I answered, "Edith&mdash;it
means this. I have never found the courage
to tell you. I am a married man. The
woman seated there is my wife. And I
love you."</p>

<p>Edith put out her arms with a low cry and
clasped me about the neck. "Harold," she
murmured, "my Harold."</p>

<p>"Have I done wrong?" I whispered.</p>

<p>"Only what I have done too," she answered.
"I, too, am married, Harold, and the man
sitting there below, John Croyden, is my
husband."</p>

<p>With a wild cry such as a cave man might
have uttered, I had leapt to my feet.</p>

<p>"Your husband!" I shouted. "Then, by
the living God, he or I shall never leave this
place alive."</p>

<p>He saw me coming as I bounded down the
rocks. In an instant he had sprung to his feet.
He gave no cry. He asked no question. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
stood erect as a cave man would, waiting for
his enemy.</p>

<p>And there upon the sands beside the sea
we fought, barehanded and weaponless. We
fought as cave men fight.</p>

<p>For a while we circled round one another,
growling. We circled four times, each watching
for an opportunity. Then I picked up a
great handful of sand and threw it flap into
his face. He grabbed a coco-nut and hit me
with it in the stomach. Then I seized a twisted
strand of wet seaweed and landed him with it
behind the ear. For a moment he staggered.
Before he could recover I jumped forward,
seized him by the hair, slapped his face twice
and then leaped behind a rock. Looking from
the side I could see that Croyden, though half
dazed, was feeling round for something to
throw. To my horror I saw a great stone lying
ready to his hand. Beside me was nothing.
I gave myself up for lost, when at that very
moment I heard Edith's voice behind me saying,
"The shovel, quick, the shovel!" The
noble girl had rushed back to our encampment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
and had fetched me the shovel. "Swat him
with that," she cried. I seized the shovel, and
with the roar of a wounded bull&mdash;or as near
as I could make it&mdash;I rushed out from the rock,
the shovel swung over my head.</p>

<p>But the fight was all out of Croyden.</p>

<p>"Don't strike," he said, "I'm all in. I
couldn't stand a crack with that kind of
thing."</p>

<p>He sat down upon the sand, limp. Seen
thus, he somehow seemed to be quite a small
man, not a cave man at all. His goatskin
suit shrunk in on him. I could hear his pants
as he sat.</p>

<p>"I surrender," he said. "Take both the
women. They are yours."</p>

<p>I stood over him leaning upon the shovel.
The two women had closed in near to us.</p>

<p>"I suppose you are <i>her</i> husband, are you?"
Croyden went on.</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>"I thought you were. Take her."</p>

<p>Meantime Clara had drawn nearer to me.
She looked somehow very beautiful with her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
golden hair in the sunlight, and the white furs
draped about her.</p>

<p>"Harold!" she exclaimed. "Harold, is it
you? How strange and masterful you look.
I didn't know you were so strong."</p>

<p>I turned sternly towards her.</p>

<p>"When I was alone," I said, "on the Himalayas
hunting the humpo or humped buffalo&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Clara clasped her hands, looking into my
face.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "tell me about it."</p>

<p>Meantime I could see that Edith had gone
over to John Croyden.</p>

<p>"John," she said, "you shouldn't sit on the
wet sand like that. You will get a chill. Let
me help you to get up."</p>

<p>I looked at Clara and at Croyden.</p>

<p>"How has this happened?" I asked. "Tell
me."</p>

<p>"We were on the same ship," Croyden said.
"There came a great storm. Even the Captain
had never seen&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know," I interrupted, "so had ours."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>"The ship struck a rock, and blew out her
four funnels&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ours did too," I nodded.</p>

<p>"The bowsprit was broken, and the steward's
pantry was carried away. The Captain gave
orders to leave the ship&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is enough, Croyden," I said, "I see it all
now. You were left behind when the boats
cleared, by what accident you don't know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't," said Croyden.</p>

<p>"As best you could, you constructed a raft,
and with such haste as you might you placed
on it such few things&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Exactly," he said, "a chronometer, a
sextant&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know," I continued, "two quadrants, a
bucket of water, and a lightning rod. I presume
you picked up Clara floating in the sea."</p>

<p>"I did," Croyden said; "she was unconscious
when I got her, but by rubbing&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Croyden," I said, raising the shovel again,
"cut that out."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," he said.</p>

<p>"It's all right. But you needn't go on. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
see all the rest of your adventures plainly
enough."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm done with it all anyway," said
Croyden gloomily. "You can do what you like.
As for me, I've got a decent suit back there
at our camp, and I've got it dried and pressed
and I'm going to put it on."</p>

<p>He rose wearily, Edith standing beside him.</p>

<p>"What's more, Borus," he said, "I'll tell
you something. This island is not uninhabited
at all."</p>

<p>"Not uninhabited!" exclaimed Clara and
Edith together. I saw each of them give a
rapid look at her goatskin suit.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Croyden," I said, "this island is
one of the West Indian keys. On such a key
as this the pirates used to land. Here they
careened their ships&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did what to them?" asked Croyden.</p>

<p>"Careened them all over from one end to the
other," I said. "Here they got water and
buried treasure; but beyond that the island was,
and remained, only the home of the wild gull
and the sea-mews&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right," said Croyden, "only it doesn't
happen to be that kind of key. It's a West
Indian island all right, but there's a summer
hotel on the other end of it not two miles away."</p>

<p>"A summer hotel!" we exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Yes, a hotel. I suspected it all along. I
picked up a tennis racket on the beach the first
day; and after that I walked over the ridge
and through the jungle and I could see the
roof of the hotel. Only," he added rather
shamefacedly, "I didn't like to tell her."</p>

<p>"Oh, you coward!" cried Clara. "I could
slap you."</p>

<p>"Don't you dare," said Edith. "I'm sure
you knew it as well as he did. And anyway, I
was certain of it myself. I picked up a copy of
last week's paper in a lunch-basket on the
beach, and hid it from Mr. Borus. I didn't
want to hurt his feelings."</p>

<p>At that moment Croyden pointed with a cry
towards the sea.</p>

<p>"Look," he said, "for Heaven's sake, look!"</p>

<p>He turned.</p>

<p>Less than a quarter of a mile away we could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
see a large white motor launch coming round
the corner. The deck was gay with awnings
and bright dresses and parasols.</p>

<p>"Great Heavens!" said Croyden. "I know
that launch. It's the Appin-Joneses'."</p>

<p>"The Appin-Joneses'!" cried Clara. "Why,
we know them too. Don't you remember,
Harold, the Sunday we spent with them on the
Hudson?"</p>

<p>Instinctively we had all jumped for cover,
behind the rocks.</p>

<p>"Whatever shall we do?" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"We must get our things," said Edith
Croyden. "Jack, if your suit is ready run and
get it and stop the launch. Mrs. Borus and
Mr. Borus and I can get our things straightened
up while you keep them talking. My suit is
nearly ready anyway; I thought some one
might come. Mr. Borus, would you mind
running and fetching me my things, they're all
in a parcel together? And perhaps if you have a
looking-glass and some pins, Mrs. Borus, I
could come over and dress with you."</p>

<p class="tb">* * * * *</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>That same evening we found ourselves all
comfortably gathered on the piazza of the
Hotel Christopher Columbus. Appin-Jones
insisted on making himself our host, and the
story of our adventures was related again and
again to an admiring audience, with the accompaniment
of cigars and iced champagne. Only
one detail was suppressed, by common instinct.
Both Clara and I felt that it would only raise
needless comment to explain that Mr. and Mrs.
Croyden had occupied separate encampments.</p>

<p>Nor is it necessary to relate our safe and
easy return to New York.</p>

<p>Both Clara and I found Mr. and Mrs.
Croyden delightful travelling companions,
though perhaps we were not sorry when the
moment came to say good-bye.</p>

<p>"The word 'good-bye,'" I remarked to
Clara, as we drove away, "is always a painful
one. Oddly enough when I was hunting the
humpo, or humped buffalo, of the Himalayas&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do tell me about it, darling," whispered
Clara, as she nestled beside me in the cab.

<h2><i>THE KIDNAPPED PLUMBER</i></h2>

<h3><i>A TALE OF THE NEW TIME</i></h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Being one chapter&mdash;and quite enough&mdash;-from the Reminiscences
of an Operating Plumber</i>)</p>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>"Personally," said Thornton, speaking
for the first time, "I never care
to take a case that involves cellar
work."</p>

<p>We were sitting&mdash;a little group of us&mdash;round
about the fire in a comfortable corner of
the Steam and Air Club. Our talk had turned,
as always happens with a group of professional
men, into more or less technical channels. I
will not say that we were talking shop; the
word has an offensive sound and might be misunderstood.
But we were talking as only a
group of practising plumbers&mdash;including some
of the biggest men in the profession&mdash;would
talk. With the exception of Everett, who had
a national reputation as a Consulting Barber,
and Thomas, who was a vacuum cleaner ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>pert,
I think we all belonged to the same profession.
We had been holding a convention,
and Fortescue, who had one of the biggest
furnace practices in the country, had read us a
paper that afternoon&mdash;a most revolutionary
thing&mdash;on External Diagnosis of Defective
Feed Pipes, and naturally the thing had bred
discussion. Fortescue, who is one of the most
brilliant men in the profession, had stoutly
maintained his thesis that the only method of
diagnosis for trouble in a furnace is to sit down
in front of it and look at it for three days;
others held out for unscrewing it and carrying
it home for consideration; others of us, again,
claimed that by tapping the affected spot with
a wrench the pipe might be fractured in such
a way as to prove that it was breakable. It
was at this point that Thornton interrupted
with his remark about never being willing to
accept a cellar case.</p>

<p>Naturally all the men turned to look at the
speaker. Henry Thornton, at the time of
which I relate, was at the height of his reputation.
Beginning, quite literally, at the bottom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
of the ladder, he had in twenty years of
practice as an operating plumber raised himself
to the top of his profession. There was much
in his appearance to suggest the underlying
reasons of his success. His face, as is usual
with men of our calling, had something of the
dreamer in it, but the bold set of the jaw indicated
determination of an uncommon kind.
Three times President of the Plumbers' Association,
Henry Thornton had enjoyed the
highest honours of his chosen profession. His
book on <i>Nut Coal</i> was recognized as the last
word on the subject, and had been crowned
by the French Academy of Nuts.</p>

<p>I suppose that one of the principal reasons
for his success was his singular coolness and
resource. I have seen Thornton enter a
kitchen, with that quiet reassuring step of his,
and lay out his instruments on the table, while
a kitchen tap with a broken washer was sprizzling
within a few feet of him, as calmly and as
quietly as if he were in his lecture-room of the
Plumbers' College.</p>

<p>"You never go into a cellar?" asked Fortes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>cue.
"But hang it, man, I don't see how one
can avoid it!"</p>

<p>"Well, I do avoid it," answered Thornton,
"at least as far as I possibly can. I send down
my solderist, of course, but personally, unless
it is absolutely necessary, I never go down."</p>

<p>"That's all very well, my dear fellow,"
Fortescue cut in, "but you know as well as I do
that you get case after case where the cellar
diagnosis is simply vital. I had a case last
week, a most interesting thing&mdash;" he turned
to the group of us as he spoke&mdash;"a double
lesion of a gas-pipe under a cement floor&mdash;half a
dozen of my colleagues had been absolutely
baffled. They had made an entirely false
diagnosis, operated on the dining-room floor,
which they removed and carried home, and
when I was called in they had just obtained
permission from the Stone Mason's Protective
Association to knock down one side of the
house."</p>

<p>"Excuse me interrupting just a minute,"
interjected a member of the group who hailed
from a distant city, "have you much trouble<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
about that? I mean about knocking the sides
out of houses?"</p>

<p>"No trouble now," said Fortescue. "We did
have. But the public is getting educated up to
it. Our law now allows us to knock the side
out of a house when we feel that we would
really like to see what is in it. We are not
allowed, of course, to build it up again."</p>

<p>"No, of course not," said the other speaker.
"But I suppose you can throw the bricks out
on the lawn."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Fortescue, "and sit on them to
eat lunch. We had a big fight in the legislature
over that, but we got it through."</p>

<p>"Thank you, but I feel I am interrupting."</p>

<p>"Well, I was only saying that, as soon as I
had made up my mind that the trouble was in
the cellar, the whole case was simple. I took
my colleagues down at once, and we sat on the
floor of the cellar and held a consultation till
the overpowering smell of gas convinced me
that there was nothing for it but an operation
on the floor. The whole thing was most successful.
I was very glad, as it happened that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
the proprietor of the house was a very decent
fellow, employed, I think, as a manager of a
bank, or something of the sort. He was most
grateful. It was he who gave me the engraved
monkey wrench that some of you were admiring
before dinner. After we had finished the
whole operation&mdash;I forgot to say that we had
thrown the coal out on the lawn to avoid any
complication&mdash;he quite broke down. He offered
us to take his whole house and keep it."</p>

<p>"You don't do that, do you?" asked the
outsider.</p>

<p>"Oh no, never," said Fortescue. "We've
made a very strict professional rule against it.
We found that some of the younger men were
apt to take a house when they were given it,
and we had to frown down on it. But, gentlemen,
I feel that when Mr. Thornton says that
he never goes down into a cellar there must
be a story behind it. I think we should invite
him to relate it to us."</p>

<p>A murmur of assent greeted the speaker's
suggestion. For myself I was particularly
pleased, inasmuch as I have long felt that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
Thornton as a <i>raconteur</i> was almost as interesting
as in the r&ocirc;le of an operating plumber.
I have often told him that, if he had not happened
to meet success in his chosen profession,
he could have earned a living as a day writer:
a suggestion which he has always taken in good
part and without offence.</p>

<p>Those of my readers who have looked
through the little volume of Reminiscences
which I have put together, will recall the narrative
of <i>The Missing Nut</i> and the little tale
entitled <i>The Blue Blow Torch</i> as instances in
point.</p>

<p>"Not much of a story, perhaps," said Thornton,
"but such as it is you are welcome to it.
So, if you will just fill up your glasses with
raspberry vinegar, you may have the tale for
what it is worth."</p>

<p>We gladly complied with the suggestion and
Thornton continued:</p>

<p>"It happened a good many years ago at a
time when I was only a young fellow fresh
from college, very proud of my Plumb. B., and
inclined to think that I knew it all. I had done<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
a little monograph on <i>Choked Feed in the Blow
Torch</i>, which had attracted attention, and I
suppose that altogether I was about as conceited
a young puppy as one would find in the
profession. I should mention that at this time
I was not married, but had set up a modest
apartment of my own with a consulting-room
and a single manservant. Naturally I could
not afford the services of a solderist or a gassist
and did everything for myself, though Simmons,
my man, could at a pinch be utilized
to tear down plaster and break furniture."</p>

<p>Thornton paused to take a sip of raspberry
vinegar and went on:</p>

<p>"Well, then. I had come home to dinner
particularly tired after a long day. I had sat
in an attic the greater part of the afternoon (a
case of top story valvular trouble) and had
had to sit in a cramped position which practically
forbade sleep. I was feeling, therefore,
none too well pleased, when a little while after
dinner the bell rang and Simmons brought
word to the library that there was a client in
the consulting-room. I reminded the fellow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
that I could not possibly consider a case at
such an advanced hour unless I were paid
emergency overtime wages with time and a
half during the day of recovery."</p>

<p>"One moment," interrupted the outside
member. "You don't mention compensation
for mental shock. Do you not draw that
here?"</p>

<p>"We do <i>now</i>" explained Thornton, "but
the time of which I speak is some years ago
and we still got nothing for mental shock,
nor disturbance of equilibrium. Nowadays,
of course, one would insist on a substantial
retainer in advance.</p>

<p>"Well, to continue. Simmons, to my surprise,
told me that he had already informed
the client of this fact, and that the answer had
only been a plea that the case was too urgent
to admit of delay. He also supplied the
further information that the client was a young
lady. I am afraid," added Thornton, looking
round his audience with a sympathetic smile,
"that Simmons (I had got him from Harvard
and he had not yet quite learned his place)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
even said something about her being strikingly
handsome."</p>

<p>A general laugh greeted Thornton's announcement.</p>

<p>"After all," said Fortescue, "I never could
see why an Ice Man should be supposed to
have a monopoly on gallantry."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," said Thornton. "For
my part&mdash;I say it without affectation&mdash;the
moment I am called in professionally, women,
as women, cease to exist for me. I can stand
beside them in the kitchen and explain to them
the feed tap of a kitchen range without feeling
them to be anything other than simply clients.
And for the most part, I think, they reciprocate
that attention. There are women, of course,
who will call a man in with motives&mdash;but that's
another story. I must get back to what I was
saying.</p>

<p>"On entering the consulting-room I saw at
once that Simmons had exaggerated nothing
in describing my young client as beautiful. I
have seldom, even among our own class, seen
a more strikingly handsome girl. She was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
dressed in a very plain and simple fashion
which showed me at once that she belonged
merely to the capitalist class. I am, as I think
you know, something of an observer, and my
eye at once noted the absence of heavy gold
ear-rings and wrist-bangles. The blue feathers
at the side of her hat were none of them more
than six inches long, and the buttons on her
jacket were so inconspicuous that one would
hardly notice them. In short, while her dress
was no doubt good and serviceable, there was
an absence of <i>chic</i>, a lack of noise about it, that
told at once the tale of narrow circumstances.</p>

<p>"She was evidently in great distress.</p>

<p>"'Oh, Mr. Thornton,' she exclaimed, advancing
towards me, 'do come to our house
at once. I simply don't know what to do.'</p>

<p>"She spoke with great emotion, and seemed
almost on the point of breaking into tears.</p>

<p>"'Pray, calm yourself, my dear young
lady,' I said, 'and try to tell me what is the
trouble.'</p>

<p>"'Oh, don't lose any time,' she said, 'do, do
come at once.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>"'We will lose no time' I said reassuringly,
as I looked at my watch. 'It is now seven-thirty.
We will reckon the time from now,
with overtime at time and a half. But if I
am to do anything for you I must have some
idea of what has happened.'</p>

<p>"'The cellar boiler,' she moaned, clasping
her hands together, 'the cellar boiler won't
work!'</p>

<p>"'Ah!' I said soothingly. 'The cellar boiler
won't work. Now tell me, is the feed choked,
miss?'</p>

<p>"'I don't know,' she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"'Have you tried letting off the exhaust?'</p>

<p>"She shook her head with a doleful look.</p>

<p>"'I don't know what it is,' she said.</p>

<p>"But already I was hastily gathering together
a few instruments, questioning her rapidly as I
did so.</p>

<p>"'How's your pressure gauge?' I asked.
'How's your water? Do you draw from
the mains or are you on the high level
reservoir?'</p>

<p>"It had occurred to me at once that it might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
be merely a case of stoppage of her main feed,
complicated, perhaps, with a valvular trouble in
her exhaust. On the other hand it was clear
enough that, if her feed was full and her
gauges working, her trouble was more likely
a leak somewhere in her piping.</p>

<p>"But all attempts to draw from the girl any
clear idea of the symptoms were unavailing.
All she could tell me was that the cellar boiler
wouldn't work. Beyond that her answers were
mere confusion. I gathered enough, however,
to feel sure that her main feed was still working,
and that her top story check valve was probably
in order. With that I had to be content.</p>

<p>"As a young practitioner, I had as yet no
motor car. Simmons, however, summoned me
a taxi, into which I hurriedly placed the girl
and my basket of instruments, and was soon
speeding in the direction she indicated. It
was a dark, lowering night, with flecks of rain
against the windows of the cab, and there was
something in the lateness of the hour (it was
now after half-past eight) and the nature of
my mission which gave me a stimulating sense<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
of adventure. The girl directed me, as I felt
sure she would, towards the capitalist quarter
of the town. We had soon sped away from
the brightly lighted streets and tall apartment
buildings among which my usual practice lay,
and entered the gloomy and dilapidated section
of the city where the unhappy capitalist class
reside. I need not remind those of you who
know it that it is scarcely a cheerful place to
find oneself in after nightfall. The thick
growth of trees, the silent gloom of the ill-lighted
houses, and the rank undergrowth of
shrubs give it an air of desolation, not to say
danger. It is certainly not the place that a
professional man would choose to be abroad in
after dark. The inhabitants, living, so it is
said, on their scanty dividends and on such
parts of their income as our taxation is still
unable to reach, are not people that one would
care to fall in with after nightfall.</p>

<p>"Since the time of which I speak we have
done much to introduce a better state of things.
The opening of day schools of carpentry,
plumbing and calcimining for the children of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
the capitalist is already producing results.
Strange though it may seem, one of the most
brilliant of our boiler fitters of to-day was
brought up haphazard in this very quarter of
the town and educated only by a French governess
and a university tutor. But at the time
practically nothing had been done. The place
was infested with consumers, and there were
still, so it was said, servants living in some of
the older houses. A butler had been caught
one night in a thick shrubbery beside one of
the gloomy streets.</p>

<p>"We alighted at one of the most sombre of
the houses, and our taxi-driver, with evident
relief, made off in the darkness.</p>

<p>"The girl admitted us into a dark hall,
where she turned on an electric light. 'We
have light,' she said, with that peculiar touch
of pride that one sees so often in her class,
'we have four bulbs.'</p>

<p>"Then she called down a flight of stairs that
apparently led to the cellar:</p>

<p>"'Father, the plumber has come. Do come
up now, dear, and rest.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>"A step sounded on the stairs, and there
appeared beside us one of the most forbidding-looking
men that I have ever beheld. I don't
know whether any of you have ever seen an
Anglican Bishop. Probably not. Outside of
the bush, they are now never seen. But at the
time of which I speak there were a few still
here and there in the purlieus of the city. The
man before us was tall and ferocious, and his
native ferocity was further enhanced by the
heavy black beard which he wore in open
defiance of the compulsory shaving laws. His
black shovel-shaped hat and his black clothes
lent him a singularly sinister appearance, while
his legs were bound in tight gaiters, as if ready
for an instant spring. He carried in his hand
an enormous monkey wrench, on which his
fingers were clasped in a restless grip.</p>

<p>"'Can you fix the accursed thing?' he asked.</p>

<p>"I was not accustomed to being spoken to
in this way, but I was willing for the girl's sake
to strain professional courtesy to the limit.</p>

<p>"'I don't know,' I answered, 'but if you
will have the goodness first to fetch me a little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
light supper, I shall be glad to see what I can
do afterwards.'</p>

<p>"My firm manner had its effect. With
obvious reluctance the fellow served me some
biscuits and some not bad champagne in the
dining-room.</p>

<p>"The girl had meantime disappeared upstairs.</p>

<p>"'If you're ready now,' said the Bishop,
'come on down.'</p>

<p>"We went down to the cellar. It was a huge,
gloomy place, with a cement floor, lighted by
a dim electric bulb. I could see in the corner
the outline of a large furnace (in those days
the poorer classes had still no central heat) and
near it a tall boiler. In front of this a man
was kneeling, evidently trying to unscrew a
nut, but twisting it the wrong way. He was
an elderly man with a grey moustache, and
was dressed, in open defiance of the law, in a
military costume or uniform.</p>

<p>"He turned round towards us and rose from
his knees.</p>

<p>"'I'm dashed if I can make the rotten thing
go round,' he said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>"'It's all right, General,' said the Bishop.
'I have brought a plumber.'</p>

<p>"For the next few minutes my professional
interest absorbed all my faculties. I laid out
my instruments upon a board, tapped the
boiler with a small hammer, tested the feed-tube,
and in a few moments had made what
I was convinced was a correct diagnosis of
the trouble.</p>

<p>"But here I encountered the greatest professional
dilemma in which I have ever been
placed. There was nothing wrong with the
boiler at all. It connected, as I ascertained at
once by a thermo-dynamic valvular test, with
the furnace (in fact, I could see it did), and
the furnace quite evidently had been allowed to
go out.</p>

<p>"What was I to do? If I told them this, I
broke every professional rule of our union. If
the thing became known I should probably be
disbarred and lose my overalls for it. It was
my plain professional duty to take a large
hammer and knock holes in the boiler with it,
smash up the furnace pipes, start a leak of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
gas, and then call in three or more of my
colleagues.</p>

<p>"But somehow I couldn't find it in my heart
to do it. The thought of the girl's appealing
face arose before me.</p>

<p>"'How long has this trouble been going
on?' I asked sternly.</p>

<p>"'Quite a time,' answered the Bishop. 'It
began, did it not, General, the same day that
the confounded furnace went out? The
General here and Admiral Hay and I have
been working at it for three days.'</p>

<p>"'Well, gentlemen,' I said, 'I don't want to
read you a lesson on your own ineptitude, and
I don't suppose you would understand it if I
did. But don't you see that the whole trouble
is <i>because</i> you let the furnace out? The boiler
itself is all right, but you see, gents, it feeds off
the furnace.'</p>

<p>"'Ah,' said the Bishop in a deep melodious
tone, 'it feeds off the furnace. Now that is
most interesting. Let me repeat that; I must
try to remember it; it feeds <i>off</i> the furnace.
Just so.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>"The upshot was that in twenty minutes we
had the whole thing put to rights. I set the
General breaking up boxes and had the Bishop
rake out the clinkers, and very soon we had
the furnace going and the boiler in operation.</p>

<p>"'But now tell me,' said the Bishop,
'suppose one wanted to let the furnace out&mdash;suppose,
I mean to say, that it was summer-time,
and suppose one rather felt that one
didn't care about a furnace and yet one wanted
one's boiler going for one's hot water, and that
sort of thing, what would one do?'</p>

<p>"'In that case,' I said, 'you couldn't run
your heating off your furnace: you'd have to
connect in your tubing with a gas generator.'</p>

<p>"'Ah, there you get me rather beyond my
depth,' said the Bishop.</p>

<p>"The General shook his head. 'Bishop,'
he said, 'just step upstairs a minute; I have
an idea.'</p>

<p>"They went up together, leaving me below.
To my surprise and consternation, as they
reached the top of the cellar stairs, I saw the
General swing the door shut and heard a key<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
turn in the lock. I rushed to the top of the
stairs and tried in vain to open the door. I
was trapped. In a moment I realized my folly
in trusting myself in the hands of these people.</p>

<p>"I could hear their voices in the hall, apparently
in eager discussion.</p>

<p>"'But the fellow is priceless,' the General
was saying. 'We could take him round to all
the different houses and make him fix them all.
Hang it, Bishop, I haven't had a decent tap
running for two years, and Admiral Hay's
pantry has been flooded since last March.'</p>

<p>"'But one couldn't compel him?'</p>

<p>"'Certainly, why not? I'd compel him
bally quick with this.'</p>

<p>"I couldn't see what the General referred
to, but had no doubt that it was the huge
wrench that he still carried in his hand.</p>

<p>"'We could gag the fellow,' he went on,
'take him from house to house and make him
put everything right.'</p>

<p>"'Ah, but afterwards?' said the Bishop.</p>

<p>"'Afterwards,' answered the General, 'why
kill him! Knock him on the head and bury<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
him under the cement in the cellar. Hay and
I could easily bury him, or for that matter I
imagine one could easily use the furnace itself
to dispose of him.'</p>

<p>"I must confess that my blood ran cold as I
listened.</p>

<p>"'But do you think it right?' objected the
Bishop. 'You will say, of course, that it is
only killing a plumber; but yet one asks
oneself whether it wouldn't be just a <i>leetle</i> bit
unjustifiable.'</p>

<p>"'Nonsense,' said the General. 'You remember
that last year, when Hay strangled the
income tax collector, you yourself were very
keen on it.'</p>

<p>"'Ah, that was different,' said the Bishop,
'one felt there that there was an end to serve,
but here&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'Nonsense,' repeated the General, 'come
along and get Hay. He'll make short work
of him.'</p>

<p>"I heard their retreating footsteps and then
all was still.</p>

<p>"The horror which filled my mind as I sat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
in the half darkness waiting for their return I
cannot describe. My fate appeared sealed and
I gave myself up for lost, when presently I
heard a light step in the hall and the key
turned in the lock.</p>

<p>"The girl stood in front of me. She was
trembling with emotion.</p>

<p>"'Quick, quick, Mr. Thornton,' she said.
'I heard all that they said. Oh, I think it's
dreadful of them, simply dreadful. Mr.
Thornton, I'm really ashamed that Father
should act that way.'</p>

<p>"I came out into the hall still half dazed.</p>

<p>"'They've gone over to Admiral Hay's
house, there among the trees. That's their
lantern. Please, please, don't lose a minute.
Do you mind not having a cab? I think
really you'd prefer not to wait. And look,
won't you please take this?'&mdash;she handed me
a little packet as she spoke&mdash;'this is a piece
of pie: you always get that, don't you? and
there's a bit of cheese with it, but please run.'</p>

<p>"In another moment I had bounded from
the door into the darkness. A wild rush<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
through the darkened streets, and in twenty
minutes I was safe back again in my own
consulting-room."</p>

<p>Thornton paused in his narrative, and at
that moment one of the stewards of the club
came and whispered something in his ear.</p>

<p>He rose.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," he said, with a grave face.
"I'm called away; a very old client of mine.
Valvular trouble of the worst kind. I doubt
if I can do anything, but I must at least go.
Please don't let me break up your evening,
however."</p>

<p>With a courtly bow he left us.</p>

<p>"And do you know the sequel to Thornton's
story?" asked Fortescue with a smile.</p>

<p>We looked expectantly at him.</p>

<p>"Why, he married the girl," explained
Fortescue. "You see, he had to go back to her
house for his wrench. One always does."</p>

<p>"Of course," we exclaimed.</p>

<p>"In fact he went three times; and the last
time he asked the girl to marry him and she
said 'yes.' He took her out of her surround<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>ings[**missing
comma?] had her educated at a cooking school, and
had her given lessons on the parlour organ.
She's Mrs. Thornton now."</p>

<p>"And the Bishop?" asked some one.</p>

<p>"Oh, Thornton looked after him. He got
him a position heating furnaces in the synagogues.
He worked at it till he died a few
years ago. They say that once he got the trick
of it he took the greatest delight in it. Well,
I must go too. Good night."

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>


<p>The scene was a striking one. It was
night. Never had the Mississippi
presented a more remarkable appearance.
Broad bayous, swollen beyond
our powers of description, swirled to and fro
in the darkness under trees garlanded with
Spanish moss. All moss other than Spanish
had been swept away by the angry flood of the
river.</p>

<p>Eggleston Lee Carey Randolph, a young
Virginian, captain of the &mdash;&mdash;th company of
the &mdash;&mdash;th regiment of &mdash;&mdash;'s brigade&mdash;even
this is more than we ought to say, and is hard
to pronounce&mdash;attached to the Army of the
Tennessee, struggled in vain with the swollen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
waters. At times he sank. At other times he
went up.</p>

<p>In the intervals he wondered whether it
would ever be possible for him to rejoin the
particular platoon of the particular regiment
to which he belonged, and of which's whereabouts
(not having the volume of the army
record at hand) he was in ignorance. In the
intervals, also, he reflected on his past life to a
sufficient extent to give the reader a more or
less workable idea as to who and to what he
was. His father, the old grey-haired Virginian
aristocrat, he could see him still. "Take this
sword, Eggleston," he had said, "use it for
the State; never for anything else: don't cut
string with it or open tin cans. Never sheathe
it till the soil of Virginia is free. Keep it
bright, my boy: oil it every now and then,
and you'll find it an A 1 sword."</p>

<p>Did Eggleston think, too, in his dire peril of
another&mdash;younger than his father and fairer?
Necessarily, he did. "Go, Eggleston!" she
had exclaimed, as they said farewell under the
portico of his father's house where she was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
visiting, "it is your duty. But mine lies elsewhere.
I cannot forget that I am a Northern
girl. I must return at once to my people in
Pennsylvania. Oh, Egg, when will this cruel
war end?"</p>

<p>So had the lovers parted.</p>

<p>Meanwhile&mdash;while Eggleston is going up
and down for the third time, which is of course
the last&mdash;suppose we leave him, and turn to
consider the general position of the Confederacy.
All right: suppose we do.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<p>At this date the Confederate Army of the
Tennessee was extended in a line with its right
resting on the Tennessee and its left resting
on the Mississippi. Its rear rested on the
rugged stone hills of the Chickasaba range,
while its front rested on the marshes and
bayous of the Yazoo. Having thus&mdash;as far
as we understand military matters&mdash;both its
flanks covered and its rear protected, its position<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
was one which we ourselves consider very
comfortable.</p>

<p>It was thus in an admirable situation for
holding a review or for discussing the Constitution
of the United States in reference to the
right of secession.</p>

<p>The following generals rode up and down in
front of the army, namely, Mr. A. P. Hill,
Mr. Longstreet, and Mr. Joseph Johnston.
All these three celebrated men are thus presented
to our readers at one and the same time
without extra charge.</p>

<p>But who is this tall, commanding figure who
rides beside them, his head bent as if listening
to what they are saying (he really isn't) while
his eye alternately flashes with animation or
softens to its natural melancholy? (In fact,
we can only compare it to an electric light bulb
with the power gone wrong.) Who is it? It
is Jefferson C. Davis, President, as our readers
will be gratified to learn, of the Confederate
States.</p>

<p>It being a fine day and altogether suitable
for the purpose, General Longstreet reined in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
his prancing black charger (during this distressed
period all the horses in both armies
were charged: there was no other way to pay
for them), and in a few terse words, about
three pages, gave his views on the Constitution
of the United States.</p>

<p>Jefferson Davis, standing up in his stirrups,
delivered a stirring harangue, about six columns,
on the powers of the Supreme Court, admirably
calculated to rouse the soldiers to frenzy.
After which General A. P. Hill offered a short
address, soldier-like and to the point, on the
fundamental principles of international law,
which inflamed the army to the highest pitch.</p>

<p>At this moment an officer approached the
President, saluted and stood rigidly at attention.
Davis, with that nice punctilio which marked
the Southern army, returned the salute.</p>

<p>"Do you speak first?" he said, "or did I?"</p>

<p>"Let me," said the officer. "Your Excellency,"
he continued, "a young Virginian officer
has just been fished out of the Mississippi."</p>

<p>Davis's eye flashed. "Good!" he said.
"Look and see if there are many more," and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
then he added with a touch of melancholy,
"The South needs them: fish them all out.
Bring this one here."</p>

<p>Eggleston Lee Carey Randolph, still dripping
from the waters of the bayou, was led
by the faithful negroes who had rescued him
before the generals. Davis, who kept every
thread of the vast panorama of the war in his
intricate brain, eyed him keenly and directed
a few searching questions to him, such as:
"Who are you? Where are you? What day
of the week is it? How much is nine times
twelve?" and so forth. Satisfied with Eggleston's
answers, Davis sat in thought a moment,
and then continued:</p>

<p>"I am anxious to send some one through the
entire line of the Confederate armies in such
a way that he will be present at all the great
battles and end up at the battle of Gettysburg.
Can you do it?"</p>

<p>Randolph looked at his chief with a flush of
pride.</p>

<p>"I can."</p>

<p>"Good!" resumed Davis. "To accomplish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
this task you must carry despatches. What
they will be about I have not yet decided. But
it is customary in such cases to write them so
that they are calculated, if lost, to endanger
the entire Confederate cause. The main thing
is, can you carry them?"</p>

<p>"Sir," said Eggleston, raising his hand in a
military salute, "I am a Randolph."</p>

<p>Davis with soldierly dignity removed his hat.
"I am proud to hear it, Captain Randolph," he
said.</p>

<p>"And a Carey," continued our hero.</p>

<p>Davis, with a graciousness all his own, took
off his gloves. "I trust you, <i>Major</i> Randolph,"
he said.</p>

<p>"And I am a Lee," added Eggleston quickly.</p>

<p>Davis with a courtly bow unbuttoned his
jacket. "It is enough," he said. "I trust you.
You shall carry the despatches. You are to
carry them on your person and, as of course
you understand, you are to keep on losing them.
You are to drop them into rivers, hide them in
old trees, bury them under moss, talk about
them in your sleep. In fact, sir," said Davis,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
with a slight gesture of impatience&mdash;it was his
<i>one</i> fault&mdash;"you must act towards them as
any bearer of Confederate despatches is expected
to act. The point is, can you do it,
or can't you?"</p>

<p>"Sir," said Randolph, saluting again with
simple dignity, "I come from Virginia."</p>

<p>"Pardon me," said the President, saluting
with both hands, "I had forgotten it."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>


<p>Randolph set out that night, mounted upon
the fastest horse, in fact the fleetest, that the
Confederate Army could supply. He was
attended only by a dozen faithful negroes,
all devoted to his person.</p>

<p>Riding over the Tennessee mountains by
paths known absolutely to no one and never
advertised, he crossed the Tombigbee, the
Tahoochie and the Tallahassee, all frightfully
swollen, and arrived at the headquarters of
General Braxton Bragg.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>At this moment Bragg was extended over
some seven miles of bush and dense swamp.
His front rested on the marshes of the
Tahoochie River, while his rear was doubled
sharply back and rested on a dense growth of
cactus plants. Our readers can thus form a
fairly accurate idea of Bragg's position. Over
against him, not more than fifty miles to the
north, his indomitable opponent, Grant, lay in
a frog-swamp. The space between them was
filled with Union and Confederate pickets,
fraternizing, joking, roasting corn, and firing
an occasional shot at one another.</p>

<p>One glance at Randolph's despatches was
enough.</p>

<p>"Take them at once to General Hood," said
Bragg.</p>

<p>"Where is he?" asked Eggleston, with
military precision.</p>

<p>Bragg waved his sword towards the east.
It was characteristic of the man that even on
active service he carried a short sword, while
a pistol, probably loaded, protruded from his
belt. But such was Bragg. Anyway, he waved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
his sword. "Over there beyond the Tahoochicaba
range," he said. "Do you know it?"</p>

<p>"No," said Randolph, "but I can find it."</p>

<p>"Do," said Bragg, and added, "One thing
more. On your present mission let nothing
stop you. Go forward at all costs. If you
come to a river, swim it. If you come to a
tree, cut it down. If you strike a fence, climb
over it. But don't stop! If you are killed,
never mind. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Almost," said Eggleston.</p>

<p>Two days later Eggleston reached the headquarters
of General Hood, and flung himself,
rather than dismounted, from his jaded
horse.</p>

<p>"Take me to the General!" he gasped.</p>

<p>They pointed to the log cabin in which
General Hood was quartered.</p>

<p>Eggleston flung himself, rather than stepped,
through the door.</p>

<p>Hood looked up from the table.</p>

<p>"Who was that flung himself in?" he asked.</p>

<p>Randolph reached out his hand. "Despatches!"
he gasped. "Food, whisky!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>"Poor lad," said the General, "you are
exhausted. When did you last have food?"</p>

<p>"Yesterday morning," gasped Eggleston.</p>

<p>"You're lucky," said Hood bitterly. "And
when did you last have a drink?"</p>

<p>"Two weeks ago," answered Randolph.</p>

<p>"Great Heaven!" said Hood, starting up.
"Is it possible? Here, quick, drink it!"</p>

<p>He reached out a bottle of whisky. Randolph
drained it to the last drop.</p>

<p>"Now, General," he said, "I am at your
service."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Hood had cast his eye over the
despatches.</p>

<p>"Major Randolph," he said, "you have seen
General Bragg?"</p>

<p>"I have."</p>

<p>"And Generals Johnston and Smith?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You have been through Mississippi and
Tennessee and seen all the battles there?"</p>

<p>"I have," said Randolph.</p>

<p>"Then," said Hood, "there is nothing left
except to send you at once to the army in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
Virginia under General Lee. Remount your
horse at once and ride to Gettysburg. Lose no
time."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>


<p>It was at Gettysburg in Pennsylvania that
Randolph found General Lee.</p>

<p>The famous field is too well known to need
description. The armies of the North and the
South lay in and around the peaceful village of
Gettysburg. About it the yellow cornfields
basked in the summer sun. The voices of the
teachers and the laughter of merry children
rose in the harvest-fields. But already the
shadow of war was falling over the landscape.
As soon as the armies arrived, the shrewder
of the farmers suspected that there would be
trouble.</p>

<p>General Lee was seated gravely on his
horse, looking gravely over the ground before
him.</p>

<p>"Major Randolph," said the Confederate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
chieftain gravely, "you are just in time. We
are about to go into action. I need your
advice."</p>

<p>Randolph bowed. "Ask me anything you
like," he said.</p>

<p>"Do you like the way I have the army
placed?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>Our hero directed a searching look over the
field. "Frankly, I don't," he said.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with it?" questioned
Lee eagerly. "I felt there was something
wrong myself. What is it?"</p>

<p>"Your left," said Randolph, "is too far
advanced. It sticks out."</p>

<p>"By Heaven!" said Lee, turning to General
Longstreet, "the boy is right! Is there anything
else?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Randolph, "your right is
crooked. It is all sideways."</p>

<p>"It is. It is!" said Lee, striking his
forehead. "I never noticed it. I'll have it
straightened at once. Major Randolph, if the
Confederate cause is saved, you, and you alone,
have saved it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p>"One thing more," said Randolph. "Is
your artillery loaded?"</p>

<p>"Major Randolph," said Lee, speaking very
gravely, "you have saved us again. I never
thought of it."</p>

<p>At this moment a bullet sang past Eggleston's
ear. He smiled.</p>

<p>"The battle has begun," he murmured.
Another bullet buzzed past his other ear. He
laughed softly to himself. A shell burst close
to his feet. He broke into uncontrolled laughter.
This kind of thing always amused him. Then,
turning grave in a moment, "Put General
Lee under cover," he said to those about
him, "spread something over him."</p>

<p>In a few moments the battle was raging in
all directions. The Confederate Army was
nominally controlled by General Lee, but in
reality by our hero. Eggleston was everywhere.
Horses were shot under him. Mules were shot
around him and behind him. Shells exploded
all over him; but with undaunted courage he
continued to wave his sword in all directions,
riding wherever the fight was hottest.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>The battle raged for three days.</p>

<p>On the third day of the conflict, Randolph,
his coat shot to rags, his hat pierced, his
trousers practically useless, still stood at Lee's
side, urging and encouraging him.</p>

<p>Mounted on his charger, he flew to and fro
in all parts of the field, moving the artillery,
leading the cavalry, animating and directing the
infantry. In fact, he was the whole battle.</p>

<p>But his efforts were in vain.</p>

<p>He turned sadly to General Lee. "It is
bootless," he said.</p>

<p>"What is?" asked Lee.</p>

<p>"The army," said Randolph. "We must
withdraw it."</p>

<p>"Major Randolph," said the Confederate
chief, "I yield to your superior knowledge.
We must retreat."</p>

<p>A few hours later the Confederate forces,
checked but not beaten, were retiring southward
towards Virginia.</p>

<p>Eggleston, his head sunk in thought, rode in
the rear.</p>

<p>As he thus slowly neared a farmhouse, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
woman&mdash;a girl&mdash;flew from it towards him with
outstretched arms.</p>

<p>"Eggleston!" she cried.</p>

<p>Randolph flung himself from his horse.
"Leonora!" he gasped. "You here! In all
this danger! How comes it? What brings you
here?"</p>

<p>"We live here," she said. "This is Pa's
house. This is our farm. Gettysburg is our
home. Oh, Egg, it has been dreadful, the
noise of the battle! We couldn't sleep for it.
Pa's all upset about it. But come in. Do
come in. Dinner's nearly ready."</p>

<p>Eggleston gazed a moment at the retreating
army. Duty and affection struggled in his
heart.</p>

<p>"I will," he said.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>

<h4>CONCLUSION</h4>


<p>The strife is done. The conflict has ceased.
The wounds are healed. North and South are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
one. East and West are even less. The Civil
War is over. Lee is dead. Grant is buried in
New York. The Union Pacific runs from
Omaha to San Francisco. There is total prohibition
in the United States. The output of
dressed beef last year broke all records.</p>

<p>And Eggleston Lee Carey Randolph survives,
hale and hearty, bright and cheery, free and
easy&mdash;and so forth. There is grey hair upon
his temples (some, not much), and his step has
lost something of its elasticity (not a great
deal), and his form is somewhat bowed (though
not really crooked).</p>

<p>But he still lives there in the farmstead at
Gettysburg, and Leonora, now, like himself, an
old woman, is still at his side.</p>

<p>You may see him any day. In fact, he is
the old man who shows you over the battlefield
for fifty cents and explains how he himself
fought and won the great battle.<br />

<h3><i>BUGGAM GRANGE</i></h3>

<h4><i>A GOOD OLD GHOST STORY</i></h4></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p>The evening was already falling as
the vehicle in which I was contained
entered upon the long and gloomy
avenue that leads to Buggam Grange.</p>

<p>A resounding shriek echoed through the
wood as I entered the avenue. I paid no attention
to it at the moment, judging it to be
merely one of those resounding shrieks which
one might expect to hear in such a place at
such a time. As my drive continued, however
I found myself wondering in spite of myself
why such a shriek should have been uttered at
the very moment of my approach.</p>

<p>I am not by temperament in any degree a
nervous man, and yet there was much in my
surroundings to justify a certain feeling of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
apprehension. The Grange is situated in the
loneliest part of England, the marsh country
of the fens to which civilization has still hardly
penetrated. The inhabitants, of whom there
are only one and a half to the square mile, live
here and there among the fens and eke out a
miserable existence by frog-fishing and catching
flies. They speak a dialect so broken as to be
practically unintelligible, while the perpetual
rain which falls upon them renders speech itself
almost superfluous.</p>

<p>Here and there where the ground rises
slightly above the level of the fens there are
dense woods tangled with parasitic creepers and
filled with owls. Bats fly from wood to wood.
The air on the lower ground is charged with
the poisonous gases which exude from the
marsh, while in the woods it is heavy with the
dank odours of deadly nightshade and poison
ivy.</p>

<p>It had been raining in the afternoon, and as
I drove up the avenue the mournful dripping
of the rain from the dark trees accentuated the
cheerlessness of the gloom. The vehicle in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
which I rode was a fly on three wheels, the
fourth having apparently been broken and
taken off, causing the fly to sag on one side
and drag on its axle over the muddy ground,
the fly thus moving only at a foot's pace in a
way calculated to enhance the dreariness of the
occasion. The driver on the box in front of me
was so thickly muffled up as to be indistinguishable,
while the horse which drew us was so
thickly coated with mist as to be practically
invisible. Seldom, I may say, have I had a
drive of so mournful a character.</p>

<p>The avenue presently opened out upon a
lawn with overgrown shrubberies, and in the
half darkness I could see the outline of the
Grange itself, a rambling, dilapidated building.
A dim light struggled through the casement
of a window in a tower room. Save for the
melancholy cry of a row of owls sitting on the
roof, and croaking of the frogs in the moat
which ran around the grounds, the place was
soundless. My driver halted his horse at the
hither side of the moat. I tried in vain to
urge him, by signs, to go further. I could see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
by the fellow's face that he was in a paroxysm
of fear, and indeed nothing but the extra
sixpence which I had added to his fare would
have made him undertake the drive up the
avenue. I had no sooner alighted than he
wheeled his cab about and made off.</p>

<p>Laughing heartily at the fellow's trepidation
(I have a way of laughing heartily in the
dark), I made my way to the door and pulled
the bell-handle. I could hear the muffled
reverberations of the bell far within the building.
Then all was silent. I bent my ear to
listen, but could hear nothing except, perhaps,
the sound of a low moaning as of a person in
pain or in great mental distress. Convinced,
however, from what my friend Sir Jeremy
Buggam had told me, that the Grange was not
empty, I raised the ponderous knocker and
beat with it loudly against the door.</p>

<p>But perhaps at this point I may do well to
explain to my readers (before they are too
frightened to listen to me) how I came to be
beating on the door of Buggam Grange at
nightfall on a gloomy November evening.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<p>A year before I had been sitting with Sir
Jeremy Buggam, the present baronet, on the
verandah of his ranch in California.</p>

<p>"So you don't believe in the supernatural?"
he was saying.</p>

<p>"Not in the slightest," I answered, lighting
a cigar as I spoke. When I want to speak very
positively, I generally light a cigar as I speak.</p>

<p>"Well, at any rate, Digby," said Sir Jeremy,
"Buggam Grange is haunted. If you want to
be assured of it go down there any time and
spend the night and you'll see for yourself."</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," I replied, "nothing will
give me greater pleasure. I shall be back in
England in six weeks, and I shall be delighted
to put your ideas to the test. Now tell me,"
I added somewhat cynically, "is there any
particular season or day when your Grange is
supposed to be specially terrible?"</p>

<p>Sir Jeremy looked at me strangely. "Why
do you ask that?" he said. "Have you heard
the story of the Grange?"</p>

<p>"Never heard of the place in my life," I
answered cheerily. "Till you mentioned it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
to-night, my dear fellow, I hadn't the remotest
idea that you still owned property in
England."</p>

<p>"The Grange is shut up," said Sir Jeremy,
"and has been for twenty years. But I keep a
man there&mdash;Horrod&mdash;he was butler in my
father's time and before. If you care to go,
I'll write him that you're coming. And, since
you are taking your own fate in your hands,
the fifteenth of November is the day."</p>

<p>At that moment Lady Buggam and Clara
and the other girls came trooping out on the
verandah, and the whole thing passed clean
out of my mind. Nor did I think of it again
until I was back in London. Then, by one of
those strange coincidences or premonitions&mdash;call
it what you will&mdash;it suddenly occurred to
me one morning that it was the fifteenth of
November. Whether Sir Jeremy had written
to Horrod or not, I did not know. But none
the less nightfall found me, as I have described,
knocking at the door of Buggam Grange.</p>

<p>The sound of the knocker had scarcely
ceased to echo when I heard the shuffling of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
feet within, and the sound of chains and bolts
being withdrawn. The door opened. A man
stood before me holding a lighted candle which
he shaded with his hand. His faded black
clothes, once apparently a butler's dress, his
white hair and advanced age left me in no
doubt that he was Horrod of whom Sir Jeremy
had spoken.</p>

<p>Without a word he motioned me to come in,
and, still without speech, he helped me to
remove my wet outer garments, and then
beckoned me into a great room, evidently the
dining-room of the Grange.</p>

<p>I am not in any degree a nervous man by
temperament, as I think I remarked before,
and yet there was something in the vastness of
the wainscoted room, lighted only by a single
candle, and in the silence of the empty house,
and still more in the appearance of my speechless
attendant, which gave me a feeling of distinct
uneasiness. As Horrod moved to and
fro I took occasion to scrutinize his face more
narrowly. I have seldom seen features more
calculated to inspire a nervous dread. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
pallor of his face and the whiteness of his hair
(the man was at least seventy), and still more
the peculiar furtiveness of his eyes, seemed to
mark him as one who lived under a great terror.
He moved with a noiseless step and at times
he turned his head to glance in the dark corners
of the room.</p>

<p>"Sir Jeremy told me," I said, speaking as
loudly and as heartily as I could, "that he would
apprise you of my coming."</p>

<p>I was looking into his face as I spoke.</p>

<p>In answer Horrod laid his finger across his
lips and I knew that he was deaf and dumb. I
am not nervous (I think I said that), but the
realization that my sole companion in the empty
house was a deaf mute struck a cold chill to
my heart.</p>

<p>Horrod laid in front of me a cold meat pie,
a cold goose, a cheese, and a tall flagon of
cider. But my appetite was gone. I ate the
goose, but found that after I had finished the
pie I had but little zest for the cheese, which
I finished without enjoyment. The cider had
a sour taste, and after having permitted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
Horrod to refill the flagon twice I found that
it induced a sense of melancholy and decided
to drink no more.</p>

<p>My meal finished, the butler picked up the
candle and beckoned me to follow him. We
passed through the empty corridors of the
house, a long line of pictured Buggams looking
upon us as we passed, their portraits in
the flickering light of the taper assuming a
strange and life-like appearance, as if leaning
forward from their frames to gaze upon the
intruder.</p>

<p>Horrod led me upstairs and I realized that
he was taking me to the tower in the east wing,
in which I had observed a light.</p>

<p>The rooms to which the butler conducted
me consisted of a sitting-room with an adjoining
bedroom, both of them fitted with antique
wainscoting against which a faded tapestry
fluttered. There was a candle burning on the
table in the sitting-room, but its insufficient light
only rendered the surroundings the more dismal.
Horrod bent down in front of the fireplace
and endeavoured to light a fire there.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
But the wood was evidently damp and the fire
flickered feebly on the hearth.</p>

<p>The butler left me, and in the stillness of
the house I could hear his shuffling step echo
down the corridor. It may have been fancy,
but it seemed to me that his departure was the
signal for a low moan that came from somewhere
behind the wainscot. There was a narrow
cupboard door at one side of the room,
and for the moment I wondered whether the
moaning came from within. I am not as a rule
lacking in courage (I am sure my reader will
be decent enough to believe this), yet I found
myself entirely unwilling to open the cupboard
door and look within. In place of doing so
I seated myself in a great chair in front of
the feeble fire. I must have been seated there
for some time when I happened to lift my eyes
to the mantel above and saw, standing upon
it, a letter addressed to myself. I knew the
handwriting at once to be that of Sir Jeremy
Buggam.</p>

<p>I opened it, and spreading it out within reach
of the feeble candlelight, I read as follows:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Digby</span>,</p>

<p>"In our talk that you will remember, I
had no time to finish telling you about the
mystery of Buggam Grange. I take for granted,
however, that you will go there and that Horrod
will put you in the tower rooms, which are the
only ones that make any pretence of being habitable.
I have, therefore, sent him this letter to
deliver at the Grange itself.</p>

<p>"The story is this:</p>

<p>"On the night of the fifteenth of November,
fifty years ago, my grandfather was murdered
in the room in which you are sitting, by his
cousin, Sir Duggam Buggam. He was stabbed
from behind while seated at the little table at
which you are probably reading this letter.
The two had been playing cards at the table
and my grandfather's body was found lying in
a litter of cards and gold sovereigns on the
floor. Sir Duggam Buggam, insensible from
drink, lay beside him, the fatal knife at his
hand, his fingers smeared with blood. My
grandfather, though of the younger branch,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
possessed a part of the estates which were to
revert to Sir Duggam on his death. Sir Duggam
Buggam was tried at the Assizes and was
hanged. On the day of his execution he was
permitted by the authorities, out of respect for
his rank, to wear a mask to the scaffold. The
clothes in which he was executed are hanging
at full length in the little cupboard to your
right, and the mask is above them. It is said
that on every fifteenth of November at midnight
the cupboard door opens and Sir Duggam
Buggam walks out into the room. It has been
found impossible to get servants to remain at
the Grange, and the place&mdash;except for the
presence of Horrod&mdash;has been unoccupied for
a generation. At the time of the murder
Horrod was a young man of twenty-two, newly
entered into the service of the family. It was
he who entered the room and discovered the
crime. On the day of the execution he was
stricken with paralysis and has never spoken
since. From that time to this he has never
consented to leave the Grange, where he lives
in isolation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wishing you a pleasant night after your
tiring journey,</p>

<p>"I remain,</p>

<p>"Very faithfully,</p>

<p style="text-align: right">"<span class="smcap">Jeremy Buggam</span>."</p></blockquote>

<p>I leave my reader to imagine my state of
mind when I completed the perusal of the
letter.</p>

<p>I have as little belief in the supernatural as
anyone, yet I must confess that there was something
in the surroundings in which I now found
myself which rendered me at least uncomfortable.
My reader may smile if he will, but I
assure him that it was with a very distinct feeling
of uneasiness that I at length managed to
rise to my feet, and, grasping my candle in my
hand, to move backward into the bedroom. As
I backed into it something so like a moan
seemed to proceed from the closed cupboard
that I accelerated my backward movement to a
considerable degree. I hastily blew out the
candle, threw myself upon the bed and drew
the bedclothes over my head, keeping,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
however, one eye and one ear still out and
available.</p>

<p>How long I lay thus listening to every
sound, I cannot tell. The stillness had become
absolute. From time to time I could dimly
hear the distant cry of an owl, and once far
away in the building below a sound as of some
one dragging a chain along a floor. More than
once I was certain that I heard the sound of
moaning behind the wainscot. Meantime I
realized that the hour must now be drawing
close upon the fatal moment of midnight. My
watch I could not see in the darkness, but by
reckoning the time that must have elapsed I
knew that midnight could not be far away.
Then presently my ear, alert to every sound,
could just distinguish far away across the fens
the striking of a church bell, in the clock tower
of Buggam village church, no doubt, tolling the
hour of twelve.</p>

<p>On the last stroke of twelve, the cupboard
door in the next room opened. There is no
need to ask me how I knew it. I couldn't, of
course, see it, but I could hear, or sense in some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
way, the sound of it. I could feel my hair, all
of it, rising upon my head. I was aware that
there was a <i>presence</i> in the adjoining room, I
will not say a person, a living soul, but a
<i>presence</i>. Anyone who has been in the next
room to a presence will know just how I felt.
I could hear a sound as of some one groping on
the floor and the faint rattle as of coins.</p>

<p>My hair was now perpendicular. My reader
can blame it or not, but it was.</p>

<p>Then at this very moment from somewhere
below in the building there came the sound of
a prolonged and piercing cry, a cry as of a soul
passing in agony. My reader may censure me
or not, but right at this moment I decided to
beat it. Whether I should have remained to
see what was happening is a question that I will
not discuss. My one idea was to get out, and
to get out quickly. The window of the tower
room was some twenty-five feet above the
ground. I sprang out through the casement in
one leap and landed on the grass below. I
jumped over the shrubbery in one bound and
cleared the moat in one jump. I went down the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
avenue in about six strides and ran five miles
along the road through the fens in three
minutes. This at least is an accurate transcription
of my sensations. It may have taken
longer. I never stopped till I found myself on
the threshold of the <i>Buggam Arms</i> in Little
Buggam, beating on the door for the landlord.</p>

<p>I returned to Buggam Grange on the next
day in the bright sunlight of a frosty November
morning, in a seven-cylinder motor car
with six local constables and a physician. It
makes all the difference. We carried revolvers,
spades, pickaxes, shotguns and an ouija board.</p>

<p>What we found cleared up for ever the mystery
of the Grange. We discovered Horrod
the butler lying on the dining-room floor quite
dead. The physician said that he had died
from heart failure. There was evidence from
the marks of his shoes in the dust that he had
come in the night to the tower room. On the
table he had placed a paper which contained a
full confession of his having murdered Jeremy
Buggam fifty years before. The circumstances
of the murder had rendered it easy for him to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
fasten the crime upon Sir Duggam, already
insensible from drink. A few minutes with
the ouija board enabled us to get a full corroboration
from Sir Duggam. He promised,
moreover, now that his name was cleared, to go
away from the premises for ever.</p>

<p>My friend, the present Sir Jeremy, has
rehabilitated Buggam Grange. The place is
rebuilt. The moat is drained. The whole
house is lit with electricity. There are beautiful
motor drives in all directions in the woods.
He has had the bats shot and the owls stuffed.
His daughter, Clara Buggam, became my wife.
She is looking over my shoulder as I write.
What more do you want?</p>

<h2>LITERARY LAPSES</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Twelfth Edition. Crown 8vo. 5s. net</i></p>

<p><i>Spectator.</i>&mdash;"This little book is a happy example of the
way in which the double life can be lived blamelessly and to
the great advantage of the community. The book fairly
entitles Mr. Leacock to be considered not only a humorist
but a benefactor. The contents should appeal to English
readers with the double virtue that attaches to work which
is at once new and richly humorous."</p>

<p><i>Globe.</i>&mdash;"One specimen of Mr. Leacock's humour, 'Boarding-House
Geometry,' has long been treasured on this side."</p>

<p><i>The Guardian.</i>&mdash;"Much to be welcomed is Professor
Stephen Leacock's 'Literary Lapses,'&mdash;this charming and
humorous work. All the sketches have a freshness and a
new personal touch. Mr. Leacock is, as the politicians say,
'a national asset,' and Mr. Leacock is a Canadian to be proud
of. One has the comfortable feeling as one reads that one
is in the company of a cultured person capable of attractive
varieties of foolishness."</p>

<p><i>Pall Mall Gazette.</i>&mdash;"The appearance of 'Literary Lapses'
is practically the English d&eacute;but of a young Canadian writer
who is turning from medicine to literature with every success.
Dr. Stephen Leacock is at least the equal of many who are
likely to be long remembered for their short comic sketches
and essays; he has already shown that he has the high spirits
of 'Max Adeler' and the fine sense of quick fun. There are
many sketches in 'Literary Lapses' that are worthy of
comparison with the best American humour."</p>

<p><i>Morning Post.</i>&mdash;"The close connection between imagination,
humour, and the mathematical faculty has never been
so delightfully demonstrated."</p>

<p><i>Outlook.</i>&mdash;"Mr. John Lane must be credited with the
desire of associating the Bodley Head with the discovery of
new humorists. Mr. Leacock sets out to make people laugh.
He succeeds and makes them laugh at the right thing. He
has a wide range of new subjects; the world will gain
in cheerfulness if Mr. Leacock continues to produce so many
excellent jests to the book as there are in the one under
notice."</p>

<p><i>Truth.</i>&mdash;"By the publication of Mr. Stephen Leacock's
'Literary Lapses' Mr. John Lane has introduced to the
British Public a new American humorist for whom a widespread
popularity can be confidently predicted."</p>

<h3>NONSENSE NOVELS</h3>

<h4><i>THIRTEENTH EDITION</i></h4>

<p class="center"><i>Crown 8vo.  5s. net</i></p>

<p><i>Spectator.</i>&mdash;"We can assure our readers who delight in
mere joyous desipience that they will find a rich harvest of
laughter in the purely irresponsible outpourings of Professor
Leacock's fancy."</p>

<p><i>Pall Mall Gazette.</i>&mdash;"It is all not only healthy satire, but
healthy humour as well, and shows that the author of
'Literary Lapses' is capable of producing a steady flow of
high spirits put into a form which is equal to the best traditions
of contemporary humour. Mr. Leacock certainly bids fair
to rival the immortal 'Lewis Carroll' in combining the
irreconcilable&mdash;exact science with perfect humour&mdash;and
making the amusement better the instruction."</p>

<p><i>Daily Mail.</i>&mdash;"In his 'Literary Lapses' Mr. Stephen
Leacock gave the laughter-loving world assurance of a new
humorist of irresistible high spirits and rare spontaneity and
freshness. By this rollicking collection of 'Nonsense Novels,'
in tabloid form, he not only confirms the excellent impression
of his earlier work, but establishes his reputation as a master
of the art of literary burlesque. The whole collection is a
sheer delight, and places its author in the front rank as a
literary humorist."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">James Douglas</span> in <i>The Star.</i>&mdash;"We have all laughed
over Mr. Stephen Leacock's 'Literary Lapses.' It is one of
those books one would die rather than lend, for to lend it is
to lose it for ever. Mr. Leacock's new book, 'Nonsense
Novels,' is more humorous than 'Literary Lapses.' That is
to say, it is the most humorous book we have had since Mr.
Dooley swum into our ken. Its humour is so rich that it
places Mr. Leacock beside Mark Twain."</p>

<p><i>Morning Leader.</i>&mdash;"Mr. Leacock possesses infinite verbal
dexterity.... Mr. Leacock must be added as a recognized
humorist."</p>

<p><i>Daily Express.</i>&mdash;"Mr. Stephen Leacock's 'Nonsense
Novels' is the best collection of parodies I have read for many
a day. The whole book is a scream, witty, ingenious, irresistible."</p>

<p><i>Public Opinion.</i>&mdash;"A most entertaining book."</p>

<h2>SUNSHINE SKETCHES OF A LITTLE TOWN</h2>

<h4>WITH A FRONTISPIECE BY CYRUS CUNEO</h4>

<p class="center"><i>Ninth Edition. Crown 8vo. 5s. net</i></p>

<p><i>The Times.</i>&mdash;"His real hard work, for which no emolument
would be a fitting reward, is distilling sunshine. This new
book is full of it&mdash;the sunshine of humour, the thin keen
sunshine of irony, the mellow evening sunshine of sentiment."</p>

<p><i>Spectator.</i>&mdash;"This is not the first but the third volume in
which he has contributed to the gaiety of the Old as well as
the New World.... A most welcome freedom from the
pessimism of Old-World fiction."</p>

<p><i>Academy.</i>&mdash;"One of the best and most enjoyable series of
sketches that we have read for some time ... they are all
bright and sparkling, and bristle with wit and humour."</p>

<p><i>Pall Mall Gazette.</i>&mdash;"Like all real humorists Mr. Leacock
steps at once into his proper position.... His touch of
humour will make the Anglo-Saxon world his reader....
We cannot recall a more laughable book."</p>

<p><i>Globe.</i>&mdash;"Professor Leacock never fails to provide a feast
of enjoyment.... No one who wishes to dispose intellectually
of a few hours should neglect Professor Leacock's admirable
contribution to English literature. It is warranted to
bring sunshine into every home."</p>

<p><i>Country Life.</i>&mdash;"Informed by a droll humour, quite
unforced, Mr. Leacock reviews his little community for the
sport of the thing, and the result is a natural and delightful
piece of work."</p>

<p><i>Daily Telegraph.</i>&mdash;"His Sketches are so fresh and delightful
in the manner of their presentation.... Allowing for
differences of theme, and of the human materials for study,
Mr. Leacock strikes us as a sort of Americanised Mr. W. W.
Jacobs. Like the English humorist, the Canadian one has
a delightfully fresh and amusing way of putting things, of
suggesting more than he says, of narrating more or less
ordinary happenings in an irresistibly comical fashion....
Mr. Leacock should be popular with readers who can appreciate
fun shot with kindly satire."</p>

<h2>BEHIND THE BEYOND</h2>

<p>AND OTHER CONTRIBUTIONS TO HUMAN
KNOWLEDGE. With 16 Illustrations by <span class="smcap">A. H. Fish</span>.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Fifth Edition. Crown 8vo. 5s. net</i></p>

<p><i>Punch.</i>&mdash;"In his latest book, 'Behind the Beyond,' he is in
brilliant scoring form. I can see 'Behind the Beyond'
breaking up many homes; for no family will be able to stand
the sudden sharp yelps of laughter which must infallibly
punctuate the decent after-dinner silence when one of its
members gets hold of this book. It is Mr. Leacock's peculiar
gift that he makes you laugh out loud. When Mr. Leacock's
literal translation of Homer, on p. 193, met my eye, a howl of
mirth broke from me. I also forgot myself over the interview
with the photographer. As for the sketch which gives its
title, to the book, it is the last word in polished satire. The
present volume is Mr. Leacock at his best."</p>

<p><i>Spectator.</i>&mdash;"Beneficent contributions to the gaiety of
nations. The longest and best thing in the book is the
delightful burlesque of a modern problem play. Miss Fish's
illustrations are decidedly clever."</p>

<p><i>Observer.</i>&mdash;"There are delicious touches in it."</p>

<p><i>Queen.</i>&mdash;"All through the book the author furnishes a
continual feast of enjoyment."</p>

<p><i>Dundee Advertiser.</i>&mdash;"'Behind the Beyond' is a brilliant
parody, and the other sketches are all of Mr. Leacock's very
best, 'Homer and Humbug' being as fine a piece of raillery
as Mr. Leacock has written. Mr. Leacock is a humorist of
the first rank, unique in his own sphere, and this volume will
add yet more to his reputation."</p>

<p><i>Aberdeen Free Press.</i>&mdash;"Exquisite quality ... amazingly
funny."</p>

<p><i>Yorkshire Daily Post.</i>&mdash;"In the skit on the problem play
which gives the book its title the author reaches his high-water
mark."</p>

<p><i>Glasgow Herald.</i>&mdash;"Another welcome addition to the gaiety
of the nations. The title-piece is an inimitably clever skit.
It is both genial and realistic, and there is a genuine laugh in
every line of it. Humour and artistry are finely blended in
the drawings."</p>

<p><i>Daily Express.</i>&mdash;"The pictures have genuine and rare
distinction."</p>

satire. Once more the author of 'Literary Lapses' has
proved himself a benefactor of his kind."</p>

<p><i>Morning Post.</i>&mdash;"All the 'Adventures' are full of the fuel
of the laughter which is an intellectual thing."</p>

<p><i>Pall Mall Gazette.</i>&mdash;"Professor Leacock shows no falling
off either in his fund of social observation or his power of
turning it to sarcasm and humour. The book is full to the
brim with honest laughter and clever ideas."</p>

<p><i>Bystander.</i>&mdash;"It is necessary to laugh, now even more
necessary than at ordinary times. Fortunately, Professor
Leacock produces a new book at the right moment. It will
cause many chuckles. He is simply irresistible."</p>

<p><i>Westminster Gazette.</i>&mdash;"Marks a distinct advance in Mr.
Leacock's artistic development."</p>

<p><i>Daily Chronicle.</i>&mdash;"This altogether delightful and brilliant
comedy of life.... Mr. Leacock's humour comes from the
very depths of a strong personality, and in the midst of a
thousand whimsicalities, a thousand searchlights on the
puerilities of human nature he never loses touch with the
essential bite of life."</p>

<p><i>Saturday Review.</i>&mdash;"Professor Leacock is a delightful
writer of irresponsible nonsense with a fresh and original
touch. These 'Arcadian Adventures' are things of sheer
delight."</p>

<h3>THE UNSOLVED RIDDLE OF
SOCIAL JUSTICE</h3>

<p>A discussion of the new social unrest, the transformation

catastrophe which it might precipitate.</p>

the conclusion that the safety of the future lies in a
progressive movement of social control alleviating at
least the misery it cannot obliterate, and based upon
the broad general principle of equality of opportunity,

<p>Harry Leon Wilson is one of the first of American
humorists, and in popularity he is a close rival of
O. Henry. His "Ruggles of Red Gap," published at
the beginning of the war, achieved a distinct success in
England, while the raciness and vivacity of "Ma
Pettengill" have furthered the author's reputation as an
inimitable delineator of Western comedy. An English
edition of this author's works is in course of preparation,
of which the above are the first volumes.</p>
